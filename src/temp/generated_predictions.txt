A few years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design contest called "The Marshmallow Challenge".
The idea is quite simple: Four-team teams must build the largest freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti, about 1m tape, about 1m thread and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow must be on top of it.
And, although it really seems simple, it is really hard because it forces people to work together very quickly.
And so I thought this was an interesting idea and I turned it into a design workshop.
It was a huge success.
Since then, I have held about 70 workshops worldwide, with students, developers and architects, even with CTOs of Fortune 50 companies, and there is something in this task that gives deep impressions of the nature of collaboration and I would like to share some of them with you.
Usually most people start to orient themselves regarding the task.
They talk about it, they think about what it will look like, they seek power.
- then invest a little time in planning and organization.
They invest a large part of their time in building structures that are constantly growing.
and finally, just before they have no more time, someone takes the marshmallow and they gently put it on the tip, step back and "Ta-da"!
But what happened then, almost always, is that the "ta-da" becomes an "uh-oh", because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse.
There are a number of people who have much more "uh-oh" moments than others, and among the worst are fresh graduates of business.
They lie, they cheat, they are confused and they produce really poor creations.
And of course there are teams with much more "ta-da" structures and among the best are fresh kindergarten graduates.
And that is quite astonishing.
As Peter told us, they produce not only the highest towers, but also the most interesting structures of all.
What they may ask is: how is this happening?
And Peter tells: "No child invests time in being the boss of the Spaghetti GmbH".
They do not invest time in power struggles.
There is another reason, however.
And that economics students were trained to find the right plan, ok!
And then to realize it.
What happens when you put the marshmallow on the tip, you have no time and what happens?
It is a crisis.
Sounds familiar, what?
What kindergarten children do differently is that they start with marshmallows and build prototypes, successful prototypes, always with marshmallows at the top, so that they have multiple opportunities to repair defective prototypes.
Architects see this kind of cooperation as the core of an iterative process.
And with every attempt the children get immediate feedback what works and what doesn't.
So the performance of working with prototypes is essential - but let's see how different teams operate.
The average for most is about 50cm, economics students make half of it, lawyers a little more, but not much, nursery children are better than adults.
Who is most successful?
Architect and engineer, fortunately.
1m is the highest I have seen.
Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures.
CEOs are slightly above average, but this is where it becomes interesting.
When you put an executive administrator on the team, they will improve significantly.
It is incredible, you look around and see 'this team will win'.
You can predict that, but why is that possible?
Because they have special abilities of process monitoring.
They are leading the process, they understand it.
And the team that rules and looks after the work will significantly improve the team’s performance.
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success.
If you have 10 teams that do typical work, you will get about 6 that have stable structures.
I tried something exciting now.
I thought we would bring the poker bet immediately.
So I offered a $10,000 prize in software for the winners.
What do you think happened to these design students?
What was the result?
This was what happened here: not one team had a stable structure.
If someone had built a 2.5cm high construction, he would have carried the price home.
So is it not interesting that high bets have a strong effect?
We repeated this exercise with the same students.
What do you think happened now?
Now you understood the advantage of prototyping.
Thus, the same bad team became one of the best.
They produced the highest construction in the shortest time.
There are therefore profound lessons for us about the nature of drive and success.
You may ask: Why would someone actually invest time in creating a marshmallow challenge?
The reason is I help create digital tools and processes to help teams to create cars, video games and "Visual Effects".
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is help them identify hidden assumptions.
Because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow.
The challenge is to build a prototype based on shared experience, a common language and a common attitude.
And that is the value of this experience, this exercise, which is so simple.
And those of you who are interested can visit marshmallowchallenge.com.
It is a blog where you see how to build the marshmallows.
There is a step-by-step guide there.
You will find crazy examples from all over the world of how people optimize and refine the system.
There are also world records.
And the basal lesson, I believe, is that construction is actually a connecting sport.
It requires that we all direct our senses to the task and that we make optimal use of our thinking, like our feelings and our actions, in the challenge that lies ahead of us.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes to move us from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.
And that can make a big difference.
Thank you.
Let us pretend that we have a machine here,
a big machine, a cool, TED-like machine, and that is a time machine.
And everyone in this room must be in.
And you can go to the past, you can go to the future; you cannot remain in the here and now.
I wonder what you would choose, because I have asked my friends this question many times recently and they all wanted to go back to the past.
They wanted to go back to the time before cars existed or Twitter or "America looks for the Superstar".
I do not know.
I am convinced that one is somehow drawn to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
I understand that.
I must say that I am not part of that group.
I do not want to go back to the past, and not because I am an adventurer -
It is because possibilities on this planet are not going back, they are going forward.
I therefore want to go into this machine and I want to go into the future.
This is the most glorious time ever on this planet, no matter what you measure: health, wealth, mobility, opportunities, falling rates of illness.
There has never been a time like this.
My great-grandparents all died when they were 60.
My grandparents pushed this figure to 70.
My parents are the 80 on heels.
So I would rather have a nine at the beginning of my death toll.
But it is not even about people like us, because this is a bigger issue than that.
A child born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world lived 100 years ago.
Think about it, it is an incredible fact.
And why is that?
The smallpox: the smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet.
They have reshaped the world’s demography in a way that no war has ever managed.
They have left; they have disappeared.
We have defeated them.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of us only a generation ago barely exist.
Diphteria, rosacea, polio...
does anyone know what that is?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are successes of the scientific method.
And, in my view, the scientific method of trying things out, seeing if it works, changing it if it does not, is one of the greatest achievements of mankind.
So that is the good news.
Unfortunately, that is all the good news, because there are a few other problems and they have been mentioned often,
and one of these is that, despite all our achievements, one billion people in the world go to bed hungry every day.
This figure is rising, and it is rising very rapidly, and that is shameful.
And not only that, we have used our imagination to thoroughly devastate this world.
Drinking water, urban land, rainforests, oil, gas: they are disappearing, and soon, and if we do not innovate ourselves out of this mess, we will also disappear.
The question is therefore: can we do that?
I believe it is clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the land in which they live.
I think we can provide this world with energy that does not simultaneously destroy it.
I really do believe that, and no, that is not wishful thinking.
But this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night.
and we have never been able to use it as sensibly as we are today.
We are on the threshold of astonishing, astonishing events in many areas, and yet I really do think that we would have to go back hundreds, 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we fought progress, when we fought these things more fiercely, on more fronts than we are now.
People are locked up in their faith, so narrowly that they cannot be freed.
Not even the truth will liberate them.
And hear, everyone has a right to their opinion; even a right to their opinion on progress,
but do you know what you are not entitled to?
They have no right to their own facts.' 'Sorry, you do not.
And I took a while to find out.
About a decade ago I wrote a small article about vaccination for The New Yorker.
And I was amazed to encounter resistance, resistance to what is ultimately the most effective measure in the field of health in the history of mankind.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I always do, I wrote an article and went on.
And soon after that I wrote an article about genetically modified food.
The same thing, but bigger.
People were playing mad.
So I wrote an article about it, and I couldn't understand why people thought that this was 'Frankenfood', why they thought that moving molecules in a certain way rather than a random way was an attack on the natural world.
But you know, I do what I do, I wrote the article, I continued to do.
I mean I am a journalist,
We typing, we submitting, we go eating, that's fine.
But these articles worried me and I could not find out why and eventually I found it out.
And that is because those fanatics who made me crazy were not fanatics at all.
They were prudent people, educated people, decent people.
They were just like the people in this room.
And that made me so confused...
but then I thought, do you know what, let us be honest:
We have reached a point where we do not have the same relationship with progress as we used to have.
We talk about it in two ways.
We are ironically talking about it, with small quotation marks: 'progress'.
Well, there are reasons for this, and I think we know what the reasons are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there is no reason why this should not be the case.
You can just name a few names and people will understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction, the US presidential election in 2000.
I mean, you know, you can choose your own list.
There are questions and problems with people whom we thought were always right, so be sceptical.
Ask questions, ask for evidence, ask for evidence.
Accept nothing as given.
But now comes the point: when you get evidence, you have to accept that evidence, and we are not good at that.
I can say that because we are now living in an epidemic of fear that I have never seen and I hope never will see again.
About 12 years ago, a story was published, a terrible story, linking the autism epidemic to the measles, mumps and rodents vaccine.
It is very frightening.
Lots of studies were carried out to see if that was true.
There should be lots of studies; that is a serious matter.
The data came in.
The data came in from the USA, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and they were all the same, no correlation, no connection, no connection at all.
It does not make any difference, because we believe in anecdotes, we believe in what we see, what we believe we see, which makes us feel real.
We do not believe in a set of documents from a government official giving us data, and I understand that, I think we all do.
But do you know what?
The result was disastrous.
catastrophic because of this fact: the US is one of the only countries in the world where measles vaccination is falling.
This is scandalous and we should be ashamed of it.
It is terrible.
What happened that we were able to do that?
Well, I understand that, and I do.
Because is there anyone who has a shepherd?
Has anyone in the audience ever seen anyone die from measles?
Not very often.
Is not happening in this country at all, but 160,000 times in the world last year.
That is a lot of deaths from measles, 20 per hour.
But because that has not happened here, we can suppress it, and people like Jenny McCarthy can run around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King Live.
And they can do that because they do not link cause and correlation.
They do not understand that these things seem to be the same, but are almost never the same.
And that is something we must learn, and learn very quickly.
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He freed us from one of the worst scourges of mankind.
No fear, no pain, polio, puff, disappeared.
The type in the middle not so much.
He is called Paul Offit.
He has just developed a Rotavirus vaccine with a few other people.
It can save the lives of 400, 500, 000 children a year in developing countries.
Pretty good, is it not?
Well, that is good, apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and how valuable they are, and people simply stopping crying.
And he says so.
Paul is therefore a terrorist.
When Paul talks in a public hearing, he cannot speak without armed guards.
He gets calls at home because people tell him they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
I do not need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
If we continue with them, diseases will return, terrible diseases, and that is what is happening.
We now have measles in that country.
And that is going to get worse and quite soon children will die again, because it is only a matter of figures.
And they will not only die of measles.
What about polio?
A fellow student of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago and said she thinks I'm a bit too shy.
No one has ever said that before.
She would not vaccinate her child against polio - certainly not.
Fine.
Why? Because we do not have polio?
Yesterday we did not have polio in that country.
Today, I do not know, perhaps this morning someone in Lagos took a plane and is flying to Los Angeles, at the moment he is over Ohio.
And in a few hours he lands and rents a car, and he comes to Long Beach, and he will attend one of those fantastic TED dinners this evening.
He does not know that he is infected with a crippling disease, nor do we know, because that is how the world works.
That is the planet we live on, so do not pretend it is not.
We love to hide ourselves in lies.
Have you taken all your vitamins this morning?
Echinacea, a small antioxidant that helps you jump.
I know that you did that because half the Americans do it every day.
They take the stuff and they take alternative remedies, and it does not matter how often we find that they are useless.
The data prove this continually.
They darken your urine, almost never do anything else.
That is fine, you want to pay $28 billion for dark urine.
I entirely agree with you.
Dark urine.
Why are we doing this?
Well, I think I understand - we hate the pharmaceutical industry.
We hate too strong a government; we do not trust the system.
We should not do so either.
It is cruel to millions of people.
It is absolutely amazingly cold and soul-killing even to those of us who can afford it.
So we are moving away from it, and where are we going?
We are going into the hands of the placebo industry.
I love the placebo industry.
But you know that this is really a serious matter, because the stuff is rubbish and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all kinds of small props here.
None of them -- gingko, fraud, echinacea, fraud, acai, I do not even know what that is, but we spend billions of dollars on it, it is fraud.
When I say that, people shout at me and say, "What cares you, let people do what they want.
That is how they feel good.'
And do you know what? You are wrong.
Because I do not care whether it is the Health Minister who says 'Well, I will not accept the evidence of my experts on mammography' or some cancer quacker who wants to treat his patient with coffee injections.
If you go down this path, where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you will reach a place you do not want to be.
You will get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beet, garlic, and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs, which we know can slow down the course of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country which is worse affected by this disease than any other.
Do not tell me that these things have no consequences.
They always have them.
Well, the most stupid epidemic we are currently experiencing is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified food and the bio-elite.
This is an idiotic debate, and it must stop.
It is a debate about words, about metaphors.
That is ideology, not science.
Everything we eat, every grain of rice, every leaf of parsley, every rosemary, has been changed by humans.
You know, there were no mandarins in paradise.
We did all that, there were no cantaloupe melons, there were no Christmas trees.
We have done it for the last 11,000 years.
Some of these worked and some did not.
We started what did not work.
Now we can do it more precisely, and of course there are risks, but we can do something like vitamin A in rice, and that can help millions of people, millions of people, to extend their lives.
Do you not want to do that?
I have to say that I do not understand that.
We are opposed to genetically modified food.
Why are we doing this?
Well, what I keep hearing is: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we do not want huge fields with one thing, that is wrong.
We do not want companies to patent life.
We do not want companies to own seeds.
And do you know what my answer to all of this is?
Yes, you are right, let us rectify that.
It is true that we have a huge food problem, but that is not science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It is law, morality, patenting.
You know that science is not a company.
It is not a country.
It is not even an idea; it is a process.
It is a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we are afraid is a real dead end and it is preventing millions of people from thriving.
You know that over the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 per cent more food than we do at present.
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
Shame on you.
They need it and we are not giving it to them.
Why? Genetically modified food.
We do not want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff, such as manioc.
Maniok is something that half a billion people eat.
It is like a potato.
It is just a bunch of calories, it is nasty.
It has no nutrients, it has no protein, and scientists are adding all of this to it.
And then people could eat it and would not become blind.
You would not starve, and do you know what?
It would be nice, it would not be Chez Panisse, but it would be nice.
All I can say about this is: why are we fighting this?
I think we should ask ourselves why we are fighting this.
Because we don’t want to push genes around?
It is not about moving genes around, it is not about chemicals.
It is not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on larger food, better food, unique food.
It is not about Rice Krispies, it is about keeping people alive, and it is high time we understood what that means.
Do you know what?
If we do not do that, if we continue as we have done so far, we will be guilty of something which I do not believe we want to be guilty of, namely high-tech colonialism.
There is no other description of what is happening here.
It is selfish, it is ugly, it is not worthy of us, and we really must stop it.
So, after this incredibly funny conversation, you may want to say, 'Do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future?'
In any case, I want that in any case.
At the moment it is in the present, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can set this time machine to anything we want.
We can move them where we want to move them and we will move them where we want to move them.
We have to conduct these conversations and we have to think, but when we go into the time machine and into the future we will be glad to have done that.
I know we can do it and, as far as I am concerned, that is what the world needs now.
Thank you.
When Steve Lopez, columnist of the Los Angeles Times, walked through the streets of the center of Los Angeles, he heard wonderful music.
She came from a man, an African-American, friendly, rough, homeless, who played on a violin that had only two strings left.
Many of you will know the story, because Steve’s article on it later became a book, and in turn a film, starring Robert Downey junior as Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the bass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory and whose promising career was tragically ended early by his paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel left Juilliard, suffered a nervous breakdown, and 30 years later he lived as a homeless person on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I recommend you all to read Steve's book or watch the movie so that you understand not only the wonderful bond that arose between these two men, but also how music helped to create this connection and how it was, when this word play is permitted, the instrument that helped to get Nathaniel out of the street.
I met Mr Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven’s First and Fourth Symphonies and came behind the stage to introduce himself to me.
He talked in a very cheerful and sociable tone about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers would never get into the Baseball World Series, all because of the silly passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony.
We started to talk about music and a few days later I got an email saying that Nathaniel was interested in giving violin lessons to me.
I must also mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment because he had already been treated with electric shocks and thrazin and handcuffs, a trauma that has tormented him throughout his life.
As a result, he is now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases, sometimes so severe that they threaten to tear him apart and he disappears for days, wandering around the streets of Skid Row, always exposed to this horror and torture of his own mind.
And Nathaniel was at exactly the same height of excitement when we started our first lesson at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in sleep.
I was afraid, not for myself, but for fear that I might lose him, that he might sink into one of his states and that I might destroy his relationship with the violin when I started talking about conductors and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin education.
So I started playing.
I played the first movement of Beethoven’s Violin Concerto.
And while I was playing, I noticed that Nathaniel was seeing a complete change.
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible drug, a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my game.
Nathaniel’s maniacal anger turned into understanding, a calm curiosity, and grace.
And as if by a miracle he took his violin and began to play some pieces of violin concertos after hearing and then asked me to play them all: Mendelssohn, Tschaikovsky, Sibelius.
We then started to talk about music, starting from Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and all the other Bs, from Bartók to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
And I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but also a close personal relationship with it.
He spoke of it with a passion and understanding that I only know from my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
By playing music and talking about music, this paranoid, confused man who had just wandered the streets of Los Angeles had become a lovely, educated, excellent, juilliard-trained musician.
Music is medicine, music changes us.
For Nathaniel, music means mental health.
Because music allows him to transform his thoughts and fantasies into something real with the help of his imagination and creativity.
And thus he escapes his torturing states.
I understood that this is the essence of art.
This is precisely the reason why we make music: so that we can transform something that is deep inside us, into a reality, through our artistic lens, through our creativity.
And the reality of that expression reaches us all, and moves, inspires and unites us.
As for Nathaniel, music brought him back to a community of friends.
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him, who recognized his talent and who respected him.
And I will keep playing music with Nathaniel, whether at the Walt Disney Concert Hall or Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I want to play something that I shamelessly stole from the cellists.
I hope you will forgive me.
I am Jane McGonigal, I design computer games.
I have been developing online games for 10 years now, and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save it in online games.
I have a plan for that, I want to convince more people, including you all, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
Currently we spend 3 billion hours a week online gaming.
Some of you may think, 'This is a lot of time for games'.
Perhaps too much time, given the urgency of the problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, the opposite is true.
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world’s most pressing problems.
Indeed, I am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we must dramatically increase that time.
I calculated that the time required is 21 billion hours of game time per week.
That may seem a little odd at first, so I repeat it so it can work: if we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts and obesity, I believe we must try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week.
No, I mean it really seriously.
This picture describes quite precisely, why?
why I believe that games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano.
He wanted to capture the emotions during the game, so he built a camera in front of the players.
This is one of the classical expressions when playing.
If you are not a player, you may miss some of the nuances in this picture.
You will probably see this sense of urgency, a little fear, but also a very great deal of concentration, very deeply focused on resolving a really difficult problem.
When you play, you will see some nuances here, the upward-drawn eyes and mouth are a sign of optimism, the eyebrows show surprise.
This is a player on the verge of a so-called epic victory.
You know that, OK, fine.
So we have some players here.
An epic victory is a result that is so very positive that you didn’t even know it was possible.
It was almost beyond imagination, and when you reach it, you are shocked.
That you are able to do that, which is an epic victory.
This player is on the verge of epic victory.
And that is what we must see on the faces of millions of problem solvers around the world as we tackle the hurdles of the next century: the faces of those who, despite all the adversities, are on the verge of epic victory.
Well, unfortunately, we tend to see this face in real life when we encounter difficult problems.
I call it the 'I am bad in life' face.
And it is actually my face, you see?
That is how I make the "I am bad in life" face.
This is a graffiti in my former home in Berkeley, California, where I spent my PhD study exploring why we are better in games than in real life.
This is a problem many players have.
We think we are not as good in reality as we are in games.
And I do not mean less successful, although that is part of it.
We achieve more in game worlds.
I mean good in connection with the motivation to do something significant, inspired to work together.
When we are in a game world, I believe that many of us will transform into our best version, be helpful at any time and immediately, try to solve the problem stubbornly, as long as necessary, try again after the failure.
And in reality, when we fail, when we encounter obstacles, we often feel different.
We feel overwhelmed, we feel defeated, we feel threatened, perhaps depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We never have these feelings when we play games, they simply do not exist in games.
And that is what I wanted to examine as a PhD student.
Why is it impossible to think in games that you cannot simply achieve everything?
How can we translate these emotions from games into reality?
So I went to look at games like World of Warcraft, which is the ideal environment for solving problems together.
And I have found some things that make epic victories in online worlds so possible.
So, first, when you enter one of these online games, especially World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters ready to entrust you with a world-saving mission, and immediately.
But not just some mission, but one that fits perfectly with your current level in the game, right?
So do it.
You never get a task you cannot solve.
But always at the edge of your skills, so you have to make an effort.
But there is no unemployment in World of Warcraft, and you don't sit around and do anything - there's always something important to do.
And there are tons of employees.
Wherever you go, hundreds of thousands of people working with you to complete your epic mission.
We do not have that easy in real life, this feeling that a bunch of employees are ready for a finger-snip.
Also there is this epic story, this inspiring story about why we are here and what we have to do, and then we get all this positive feedback.
You've probably heard of "Level high" and "+1 strength" or "+1 intelligence".
This constant feedback does not exist in real life.
When I leave this stage, I do not have: +1 talking and +1 crazy idea, +20 crazy idea.
I don't get this feedback in real life.
So the problem with cooperation online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it is so satisfying to be on the verge of epic victory at any time that we prefer to spend our time in these game worlds.
They are simply better than the reality.
To date, all World of Warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
That is not necessarily a bad thing.
It may sound awful.
But to see it in context: 5.93 million years ago our first primate ancestors began to rise up.
The first genuine primacy, then.
OK, so when we talk about how much time we spend on games at the moment, it only makes sense when we consider the scale of human development, which is extraordinary.
But it is also appropriate, because it turns out that by spending all this time on gambling, we are actually changing what we as human beings are capable of doing.
We are developing into a community-thinking, warm being.
That is the truth, and I believe it.
Consider this interesting statistic recently published by a Carnegie Mellon University researcher: the average young person today in a country with a strong gaming culture spends 10,000 hours online gaming until the age of 21.
So 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting figure for two reasons:
First of all, for children in the US, 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school, from 5th grade to high school - if you never miss it - so we have a complete list of hours.
Parallel education path, where young people learn what it means to be a good player just as much as anything they learn in school.
And perhaps some of you have read the new book by Malcolm Gladwell, 'Overflight', so you know his theory of success, the theory of success of 10,000 hours.
It is based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours struggling to study any subject until the age of 21 we become master masters in it.
We will be as good in doing whatever, as the most important people in the world.
So what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master players.
So the big question is: "How exactly are players masterfully good?"
If we could find out, we would have almost unprecedented human potential.
So many people in the world today spend at least one hour a day playing online games.
These are our master players, 500 million people who are exceptionally good at "something".
And in the next decade we will have another billion players who are exceptionally good in whatever.
If you haven't heard it yet, please click here.
The gaming industry is developing consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks instead of broadband Internet, so that players can play online all over the world, especially in India, China, Brazil.
An additional billion players are expected to be added over the next decade.
This makes us a total of 1.5 billion players.
So I started to think about what it is that makes us master these games.
Here are the 4 things I found.
OK, imagine that it is like extreme self-motivation.
Urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately, to overcome a hurdle, together with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
Players always believe that epic victory is possible and that it is always worth trying, and doing so now.
Players are not sitting around.
Players are masters in spinning thick social networks.
There are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we have played with them, even if they have defeated us badly.
The reason is that playing a game with someone requires a lot of trust.
We trust that someone will spend time with us, that the rules will be followed, that we will have the same goal and stay on until the end of the game.
So playing together enables the growth of bonds, trust and co-existence.
As a result, we are building stronger social relationships.
Good productivity, fantastic!
You know, there is a reason why the average Word of Warcraft player plays 22 hours a week, as part-time work.
The reason is that when we play, we are actually more happy to work hard than when we relax or do nothing.
We know that as human beings, we work optimally when we do hard, significant work.
And players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job.
And finally, epic importance.
Players love to become part of formidable missions on planet scale.
Here is some background information to put it in perspective.
The second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 entries, is the World of Warcraft Wiki.
Five million people use it every month.
You have collected more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic in any other wiki in the world.
They create an epic story.
They create an epic source of knowledge about World of Warcraft.
Well, these are four superpowers that lead to a single result: players are super-powerful, hopeful individuals.
They are people who believe that they can change the world as individuals.
And the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds, but not the real worlds.
That is the problem I am trying to solve.
Edward Castronova is a historian.
His work is brilliant, he examines why.
People spend so much time, energy and money in online worlds.
And he says: 'We are witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds and online gaming environments'.
And that is what an economist does, so it is logical.
And he says... Not like me... I develop games, I'm a bit overzealous.
So he says it makes sense, because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life.
You can build stronger social bonds in games than in real life, and you get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life.
So he says it is quite logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world at the moment.
I agree first of all, that is logical.
But it is definitely not an optimal situation.
We must start turning the real world into a game.
My inspiration comes from an event that goes back 2,500 years.
Do you know that there are these antique cube, made of sheep ankles?
Before these fantastic game controllers there were sheep ankles.
And if you are familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, you may know this story, the story of how and why games were invented.
According to Herodotus, games, especially dice games, were invented in the Kingdom of Lydians during famine.
It is said that there was such a great famine that the King of Lydians decided on a crazy idea.
People suffered; people fought.
It was an extreme situation, and an extreme solution was needed.
So, according to Herodotus, they invented the dice game and agreed a national strategy: one day you would eat, the next day you would play.
And they would be so deeply immersed in the dice game, because games are so fascinating and surround us with a satisfied, happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat.
And then, the next day you would play and the next day you would eat.
And according to Herodotus, they survived this famine for 18 years by eating one day and playing the next.
I think that we are using games in the same way today.
We use games to escape the suffering of the real world, we use games to escape everything that does not work in the real world, everything that is not satisfactory in real life, and we get what we need from games.
But that does not have to be the end.
That is the excitement.
According to Herodotus, the famine did not improve after 18 years, so the king decided to start a last dice game.
They divided the kingdom into two halves.
They played a dice game and the winners were allowed to embark on an epic adventure.
They left Lydians and went on a search for a new homeland, leaving just as many people as there were food to survive and looking for a place to thrive with the rest.
That sounds crazy, is it not?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire have the same DNA as the old Lydians.
So scientists recently concluded that Herodotus's crazy story is indeed true.
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling that lasted nearly 20 years, which might explain the famine.
So this crazy story may be true.
Perhaps they actually saved their people by playing games, having spent 18 years playing games and then having this idea and learning so much about playing together that they saved the whole of civilisation.
So we can do that.
We have been playing Warcraft since 1994.
This was the first real-time strategy game.
The World of Warcraft series was released 16 years ago.
You played dice games for 18 years, we have been playing Warcraft for 16 years.
I would say that we are ready for our own epic game.
So they sent half of their civilisation to the search for a new world, so I take my 21 billion hours of playing a game a week.
We should agree that half of us spend one hour a day playing until we have solved the problems of the real world.
I know you will ask: 'How do we solve problems in the real world?
In the last few years I have devoted my work to this question at the Institute for the Future.
We have this banner in our office in Palo Alto, it expresses how we should understand the future.
We do not want to try to predict the future.
What we want is to create the future.
We want to imagine the best possible outcome, and then empower people to turn that vision into reality.
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunities to achieve them.
I will briefly show you three games I have designed to try to bring people epic victories in their own future.
This is 'World without oil'.
The game is from 2007.
It is an online game in which you have to overcome an oil shortage.
The oil shortage is invented, but we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and you really do live your real life without oil.
When you are a child, you have to find out how you would live your real life if it were true, and we ask you to blog about it, to post videos or photos.
We tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 and we have accompanied them since then for the last three years.
And I can tell you it was a changing experience.
No one wants to change their lives because it is good for the environment or because we should.
But if you are in an epic adventure and are told, "We're running out of oil."
This is a fascinating adventure to be undertaken.
Find out how you would survive, most of our players have maintained the habits they learned in the game.
So we have set ourselves a greater, greater goal for the next world-saving game than just oil shortages.
We developed the game "Superstruct" at the Institute for the Future.
The starting point is the calculation of a supercomputer that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
This supercomputer is called the Global Extinction Sensitivity System, of course.
We have almost designed the call for players to sign up like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies where there is the "Dream Team" - you have the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-slavery man and only together can they save the world.
But in our game, instead of just 5 people, we say everyone is in the Dream Team, and it is our task to create the future for energy, food, health, security and the future of social justice.
8,000 players played the game for 8 weeks.
You found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read if you google "Superstruct".
And the last game we will release on 3 March is a game in cooperation with the World Bank.
When you complete the game, you will receive the World Bank's "Social Reshaper", a prize which goes to the end of 2010.
We work with universities throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and invite them to learn about social transformation.
We have a comic to add to it, we have "high level" for regional understanding, knowledge sharing, sustainability, vision and ingenuity.
I would like to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world, especially in developing areas, who will benefit from thinking together about their own social ventures to save the world.
I will now finish.
I would like to ask you something.
What do you think will happen next?
We have all these fantastic players, we have games that show us what we can do, but we have not yet saved the real world.
Well, I hope you will agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life and that games are of great importance for change.
We have all these superpowers, felicitous productivity, the ability to establish tight social networks, urgency optimism, and the desire for epic importance.
I really hope that together we will play important games to survive another century on this planet.
And I hope you will design and play such games with me.
Looking forward to the next decade, I am sure of two things: that we can create any imaginable future, and that we can play all kinds of games, so let the world-changing games begin!
Thank you.
For some time now, I have been interested in the placebo effect, and it may seem strange that a magician should be interested in it unless you, like me, see it as 'a deception that becomes real when someone believes it firmly enough'.
In other words, sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies, the placebo effect, only because the person thinks what is happening to him or her is a pharmaceutical or some kind of... In pain management, for example, if the patient only believes sufficiently strongly in it, there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
A deception becomes something real because someone perceives it as such.
So that we can understand each other, I would like to show you a basic, very simple trick.
And I will show you how it works: it is a trick that has been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.
I myself learned it from Cub Scout Magic of the Scouts in the 1970s.
I will execute it for you and then explain it.
And then I will explain why I explain it.
So, see what is happening.
The knife you can examine; my hand you can examine.
I will just hold the knife in my fist.
I shall withdraw my sleeves.
And to make sure that nothing goes out of my sleeves or escapes, I will simply push my wrist together right here.
In this way you can see that nothing moves at any time, and as long as I press this button, nothing can move or come out of my sleeves.
And the aim is quite simple.
I will open my hand and hopefully, if everything goes well, the knife will be held by my sheer physical magnetism.
It is actually so firmly in place that I can shake it without the knife falling down.
Nothing wanders in my sleeves or comes out, no trickery, and you can investigate everything.
Ta-da!
Well, this is a trick I often teach to small children interested in making magic, because you can learn a lot about deception by looking at it, although it is a very easy trick to do.
I suspect many of you in this Chamber know this trick.
It works as follows:
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say that I close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or comes out, and that is a lie.
The reason I hold my wrist is that this is the real secret of the illusion.
In fact, when I turn my hand away from you so that you can see it from the back, this finger, my index finger, simply moves from where it was to a position where it is stretched out.
Great Trick?
Behind the scenes is someone who has not had a childhood.
So he is here, exactly.
And when I turn around, the finger changes its position.
And now we could talk about why this is a deception, why we do not realize that there are only three fingers to see below: because the mind and the way it processes information does not count them individually, one, two, three, but sees them as a group.
But that is not the point at all, and then I open my hand.
Of course it is held there, but not by the magnetism of my body, but by a trick, by my pointing finger, which is now there.
And when I close my hand, the same thing happens by turning back, which hides the finger moving back again.
I take that hand away and here is the knife.
This trick can be shown to your friends and neighbors.
Well, what has that got to do with the placebo effect?
A year or so ago, I read a study that really struck me.
I am not a doctor or a researcher, and so it was a very astonishing thing to me.
It has actually turned out that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill, in the form of an aspirin tablet, it is simply a round white pill that has a certain measurable effect.
But if you change the form in which you give the placebo, for example, into a smaller pill and color it blue and a letter on it, it is actually measurably more effective.
And that although none of them is any pharmaceutical... they are just sugar pills.
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
What really made me freak out.
It turned out, however, that this is not all.
When taken in capsules, they are even more effective than tablets of any form.
A coloured capsule, yellow at one end and red at the other, is better than a white capsule.
Dosage also plays a role.
A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills - I do not recall the exact statistics at this stage, so I am sorry.
But the crucial thing is...
... that the doses also play a role.
And shape matters.
And if you want the ultimate placebo effect, you have to go to the needle.
A syringe with an ineffective substance - a few milliliters of an ineffective substance injected into a patient.
This makes a very strong image in the head, which is much stronger than a white pill.
This graphic is really... I'll show it to you another time when we have a projector.
The fact is, therefore, that the white pill does not work as well as the blue pill, which does not work as well as a capsule, which does not work as well as the needle.
Nothing of this has any real pharmaceutical capacity, but only our belief in it has a stronger effect on us.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick.
I take something that is obviously a deception and let it look real.
We know from that study that a stick is needed if we are to get to the point.
This is a 18 cm long hat needle, it is very, very pointed and I will sterilize it a little bit.
This is really my meat, it is not Damian's special breeding meat.
This is my skin, not a special effect from Hollywood.
I will now stuck this needle in my skin and push it through until it leaves on the other side.
If you feel ill - if you fall easily into impotence - I showed it to a few friends last night in the hotel room, and to some people I didn't know, and one woman almost fell impotent.
So I suggest that if you get angry quickly, you look away for the next 30 seconds, or, know what, I will do the first sensitive part here behind the scenes.
You can see it right away, but you can also look away if you want.
So, right here, where my meat starts, I will simply make a small injection on the bottom of my arm.
I am really sorry, is that crazy?
And now a little bit through my skin and on the other side so again out.
Now we are in the same situation as we were in the case of the knife trick.
Around.
But now you cannot count my fingers, can you?
So I will show you one, two, three, four, five.
Well, yes, yes.
I know what people think when they see it.
They say, 'OK, he's certainly not so stupid and is staining his own skin just to talk to us for a few minutes'.
Well, then I will show you it.
What is the situation here?
Yes, I know, and the people behind say, 'OK, I didn't see it right'.
The people in the annexes are now entering.
Let me show you it from close range.
This is really my skin, not a special effect from Hollywood.
That is my meat and I can turn it around.
I am sorry, if you feel ill, look away, do not look at it.
The people behind the scenes, or those who will see it on video later on, will say, 'Well, it looks quite impressive, but if it were real, it would - see, there is a hole here and there, if it were real, it would bleed'.
Okay, let me squeeze a little blood out of you.
Yes, here it is.
Normally I would take the needle out now.
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds.
But I think, in this context, and with the intention of making a deception into something real, I will just leave the needle in there and go away.
We will meet again a few times in the next few days.
I hope you are already looking forward to it, and thank you.
So I have known many fish in my life.
I only loved two.
This first, it was more like a passionate affair.
It was a beautiful fish, tasty, good consistency, rich in content, a best seller on the menu.
What a fish.
Even better, it was bred in aquaculture according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability.
So you could feel comfortable selling it.
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day the boss of the company called and asked if I could talk about the sustainability of the farm at an event.
"Of course," I said.
Here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks: how do we keep fish on our menus?
In the last 50 years we have been fishing the seas as we have been fighting forests.
It is hard to overestimate the destruction.
90 per cent of the big fish, those we love, the tuna, the halibut, the salmon, the swordfish, they have collapsed.
There is almost nothing left.
So, whether we like it or not, aquaculture, fish farming, will be part of our future.
There are many arguments against this, but fish farms pollute the environment, most of them, at any rate, and they are inefficient, for example tuna, which is a great disadvantage.
It has a feed recovery of 15 to one.
That means that 15 pounds of wild fish are required to get one pound of breeding tuna.
Not very sustainable.
Also does not taste very good.
So here was finally a company that tried to do it right.
I wanted to support it.
The day before the event I called the head of the company's public relations department.
Let us call him Don.
'Don't you,' I said, 'just to have the facts right, you are famous for growing as far out in the sea as you do not pollute the environment'.
"That is true," he said. "We are so far out that the waste from our fish is distributed, not concentrated."
And then he added, "We are actually a world of our own.
This feed recycling from 2.5 to 1", he said.
"The best in the industry."
2.5 to one, great.
"What do you feed?
'Sustainable proteins' he said.
"Great," I said. "Stop.
And that evening I was in bed and thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.
I said, 'Don, what, for example, are sustainable proteins?'
He said he did not know, he would ask.
Well, I telephoned with a few people in the company, nobody could give me a proper answer until I finally telephoned the head biologist.
Let us call him Don.
"Don," I said, "what, for example, are sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal, and then he said, chicken pellets.
I said 'chicken pellets'.
He said: 'Yes, feathers, skin, bone meal, residues, dried and processed into feed'.
I said, 'How much percentage of your feed is chicken?'
, assuming perhaps 2%.
"Well, that is about 30 percent," he said.
I said, 'Don, what is sustainable in feeding chickens to fish?'
There was a long break in the conductor's chair and he said, 'There are simply too many chickens in the world'.
I fell in love with this fish.
No, not because I am a self-righteous gourmet and a good man.
I am.
No, I didn't really fall in love with this fish because, I swear to God, after this conversation the fish tasted like chicken.
This second fish, that is another kind of love story.
It is the romantic way, the way in which the better you get to know your fish, the more you love the fish.
I first ate it in a restaurant in southern Spain.
A friend of mine had been talking about this fish for a long time.
It has, in a sense, confounded us.
He came to the table with a light, almost shimmering white color.
The cook had cooked it.
Stop twice.
Amazingly, it was still delicious.
Who can let a fish taste so good after it has been cooked?
I cannot, but this guy can.
Let us call him Miguel, because he is actually called Miguel.
No, he did not cook the fish and he is not a cook, at least in the way you and I understand it.
He is a biologist at Veta La Palma.
This is a fish farm in the south-west corner of Spain.
It is close to the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.
Until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of Argentines.
They reared meat cattle on what was basically wetlands.
They did so by depleting the land.
They built this complicated series of canals and pushed water out of the land and into the river.
Well, they could not make it work, not economically.
And it was a disaster ecologically.
It killed about 90 percent of the birds, which is many birds for this place.
In 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental awareness bought the land.
What have they done?
They have reversed the flow of water.
You have literally shifted the lever.
Instead of squeezing the water out, they used the channels to draw the water back into the water.
They flooded the channels.
They created 11,000 hectares of fish breeding -- cod, sea bream, shrimp, eel -- and Miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction.
The farm is incredible.
I think you have never seen such a thing.
They stare out onto the horizon, which is one million miles away, and all they see are flooded canals and this dense, lush march.
I was there with Miguel not long ago.
He is an incredible guy, three parts Charles Darwin and one part "A Crocodile to Kiss".
Okay, we were fighting through the wetlands and I crawl and sweat, I have mud to my knees, and Miguel is holding a biology lecture in peace.
Here he highlights a rare gilt eel.
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
Here, here he sees a pattern of bundles that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe.
It turns out that Miguel spent most of his career in the Mikomi National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became such a fish expert.
He said, 'Fish? I do not know anything about fish.
I am an expert on relations'.
And then he goes and jumps into more talk of rare birds and algae and strange water plants.
And do not misunderstand me, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, so in the kind.
It is great, but I was in love.
And my head became weak about this smoked piece of delicious fish I had the previous evening.
So I cut him off and said, 'Miguel, how is it that your fish tastes so good?'
He pointed at the algae.
"I know boy, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relations, that is incredible.
But what do your fish eat?
How is the recycling of feed?"
Well, he continues to tell me that it is such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wilderness.
Plant biomass, phytoplankton, zooplankton, that is what feeding fish.
The system is so healthy that it is completely self-renewing.
There is no feed.
Who heard of a farm that does not feed its animals?
Later that day I went around this plot with Miguel and I asked him, I said: "For a place that seems so natural", different from any farm I've ever been on, "how do you measure success?"
At that moment it was as if a film director had asked for a change of stage.
And we bent around the corner and we saw the most incredible sight, thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literally pink carpet as far as the eye can see.
"That is a success," he said.
"Look at her bellies, pink.
They are eating up'.
I was completely confused.
I said, 'Miguel, do not they swallow your fish?'
"Yes," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds.
Well, last year there were 600 000 birds on this property, more than 250 different species.
It has become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe.
I said, 'Miguel, is a well-fledged bird population not the last one you want to have on a fish farm?'
He shaked his head, no.
He said: 'We are growing extensively, not intensively.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the prawns.
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton.
The pinker the belly, the better the system.'
Well, let us reconsider: a farm that does not feed its animals and a farm that measures its success by the health of its robbers.
A fish farming, but also a bird reserve.
Oh, and by the way, these flamingos should not even be there in the first place.
They breed in a town 240 kilometres away, where the soil is better suited for nesting.
Every morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm.
And every evening they fly back 240 kilometers.
You do so because you can follow the white line of the A92 highway.
Seriously.
I had imagined a kind of penguin journey, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, do you fly 240 kilometers to the farm and then fly 240 kilometers back in the evening?
Do they do it for the children?"
He looked at me as if I had just cited a song by Whitney Houston.
He said, 'No, you are doing it because the food is better'.
I did not mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delicious, and I do not like fish skin; I do not like it sauted, I do not like it crunchy.
It is this stiff, stained taste.
I almost never cook with it.
And yet, when I tasted it in this restaurant in southern Spain, it did not taste like fish skin at all.
It tasted sweet and pure, as if you were taking a bite from the ocean.
I mentioned this to Miguel and he noded.
He said: "The skin looks like a sponge.
It is the last defence before something enters the body.
It has evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities."
And then he added: 'but our water does not contain impurities'.
A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its robbers.
And then I realised that when he says that a farm which has no impurities, he is exaggerating enormously, because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir River.
It is a river that carries all the things that rivers nowadays tend to carry, such as chemical pollutants, the discharge of pesticides.
And when it has fought through the system and leaves it, the water is cleaner than it came in.
The system is so healthy that it cleans the water.
So not only a farm that does not feed its animals, not only a farm that measures its success by the health of its robbers, but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant, not only for these fish, but also for you and me.
Because when the water leaves the water sinks into the Atlantic.
I know that it is a drop in the ocean, but I take it, and you should do so, because this love story, however romantic, is also revealing.
One could say that it is a recipe for the future of good food, whether we are talking about barking or cattle.
What we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture, one in which food really tastes good.
But for many people, this is a bit too radical.
We are not realists, we are lovers.
We love weekly markets, we love small family businesses, we talk about regional food, we eat organic.
And if you claim that these are the things that guarantee the future of good food, somebody stands up somewhere and says, "Hey people, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?
How will you feed the world?"
Can I be honest?
I do not like this question.
No, not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just food.
One billion people will starve today.
One billion -- more than ever -- because of glaring inequalities in distribution, not total production.
Well, I do not like this question because it has shaped the logic of our food system for the last 50 years.
Feed grain to plant eaters, pesticide to monocultures, chemicals to the earth, chickens to fish, and all this time the agricultural industry has simply asked: 'If we feed more people at a cheaper price, how terrible can that be?'
That was the motivation, it was the justification, it was the American agriculture plan.
We should call it what it is, a business in a process of being processed, a business that quickly takes up ecological capital, which makes this production possible.
This is not a trade and it is not agriculture.
Our grain chamber is today under threat, not because of a fall in supply, but because of a fall in resources,
not by the latest tractor and tractor inventions, but by fertile land, not by pumps, but by fresh water, not by chain saws, but by forests, and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let us start with the question: how will we feed ourselves?
Or better still, how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself?
To do that, do not look at the agricultural industry model for the future.
It is really old and it is done.
Capital, chemistry and machines are at the top of the list and it has never produced anything really good for food.
Instead, let us look at the environmental model.
That is what takes two billion years of working experience.
Look at Miguel, farmer like Miguel,
holdings that are not worlds in themselves, holdings that restore rather than reuse, holdings that grow extensively rather than intensively, farmers who are not just producers but experts in relations,
because they are also experts for taste.
And if I'm really honest, they are a better cook than I'll ever be.
You know, I am right, because if that is the future of good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a huge amount of science fiction.
In my school days I went to school by bus, every day for one hour.
And my nose was always in a book, a science fiction book, which took my thoughts to other worlds and which, in a storytelling way, satisfied my deep-seated, insatiable curiosity.
This curiosity also proved to be apparent when I was not in school, when I wandered through the forests, collected "samples", brought frogs and snakes and beetle and pond water, brought everything home and looked under the microscope.
I was absolutely enthusiastic about science, you know.
It was always about trying to understand the world and exploring the limits of what is possible.
And my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my surroundings, because then, in the late 1960s, we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea.
Jacques Cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating shows showing animals and places and a world full of wonders that we never could have imagined before.
I think that fits perfectly with that science fiction role.
And I was an artist.
I could draw. I could paint.
And since there was neither video games nor this oversaturation with computer-generated films nor the whole image language in the media landscape, I had to create the images in my head.
When we were children, we read a book, we took the description of the author and projected it onto the canvas in our minds.
My reaction was to draw and paint aliens, alien worlds, robots, spaceships and all that.
In math lessons, I was constantly caught by the teacher drawing behind the textbook.
Creativity had to go somehow out.
And something interesting happened: what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteau’s shows was the idea of a world which we entirely knew nothing about here on our earth itself.
I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship, which seemed quite unlikely.
But here was a world that I could actually enter, here on earth, and it was as fascinating and exotic as everything I had always imagined when I read these books.
So when I was 15 I decided to become a diver.
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada, 1 000 km from the next ocean.
I was not discouraged by this.
I annoyed my father until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo, New York, just across the border where we lived.
I took my diving lesson in a YMCA pool in mid-winter in Buffalo, New York.
But the ocean, a real ocean, I only saw two years later when we went to California.
Since then, in the 40 years that have passed, I have spent around 3000 hours under water, 500 hours of which in diving boats.
And I have learned that the world of the deep sea, even in the shallow oceans, is so rich in fascinating life that we can hardly imagine it.
Nature's imagination knows no boundaries, in contrast to our own, pitiful human imagination.
To this day, I have a deep respect for what I see on my dives.
And my love of the ocean continues, with the same intensity as ever.
As an adult, I chose a profession which was filmmaking.
This seemed to be the best way to combine my inner urge to tell stories with my need to create pictures.
As a child I always draw comic books and so on.
So films were the way to bring pictures and stories together, and that fit together.
Of course, the stories I chose were from the science fiction area: "Terminator", "Aliens", and "Abyss".
At Abyss I could combine my passion for the underwater world and diving with filming.
So my two passions are almost intertwined.
Something interesting happened in "Abyss": To solve a storyline problem in this movie - namely, we had to create a kind of fluid water being - we resorted to computer-generated animation, CG.
What emerged was the first computer-generated soft surface figure ever seen in a movie.
The film did not raise money, in fact it only paid for its production costs, but I noticed something fascinating: the audience around the world was hypnotized by the magic that it created.
Arthur Clarke's law states that advanced technology and magic can no longer be distinguished from each other.
So you saw something magical.
And I found that incredibly exciting.
And I thought to myself, "Wow, that absolutely must be included in film art."
So we went much further in "Terminator 2", my next movie.
Together with ILM we created the liquid metal type there, and the success depended on how this effect would arrive.
Again we had created something magical and the effect on the audience was the same, although we made a bit more money with the movie.
Based on these two experiences, a whole new world was reached, a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers.
So I founded a company together with my good friend Stan Winston, who was the best make-up and creature designer at that time, called "Digital Domain".
The basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with optical printers etc. and start with digital productions straight away.
We did that and thus secured a competitive advantage for a time.
But in the mid 90s we realized that we were making too slow progress in creatures and characters design - which was what we actually started the company for.
I wrote this play "Avatar" which was supposed to push the bar in terms of visual effects and computer-generated effects to a whole new level, with realistic human, expressive characters created by CG, and the main characters were all CG, and the world was CG.
But the bar was very low, and people in my company told me that we are not yet in a position to do that for the time being.
So I postponed it and made this other movie about the big ship that sinks.
I sold it to the film studio as "Romeo and Juliet on a ship" and it became a love film of epic proportions, a passionate film.
But I wanted to dive into the real wreck of the Titanic.
That is why I made the film.
That is the truth, but the studio didn't know.
But I convinced them by saying: "We are diving to the wreck, we are filming the real wreck.
We will show it in the opening sequence of the film.
This is incredibly important, it is a good marketing pendant.'
And I persuaded them to finance an expedition.
It sounds crazy, but it is because one’s imagination can create a reality.
We actually created a reality six months later, where I found myself in a Russian dive boat four kilometres below the surface of the North Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a bullauge.
It was not a movie, no HD, it was real.
So I really was shocked.
And the preparations were enormous: we had to build cameras and lights and everything possible.
And I noticed how much these deep-sea dives resemble a space mission.
Well, they were also highly technical and required extensive planning.
You get into this capsule, then you float down into this dark, hostile environment, where there is no hope of salvation unless you get back.
And I thought to myself, "Wow, that's just as if I was in a science fiction movie.
That is really cool.'
I was absolutely obsessed with exploring the deep sea.
They were a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise, a very interesting exercise.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn’t give me.
Because, as you know, I could imagine a being for whom we could then create a visual effect, but I could not imagine what I would see outside the window.
In some of the following expeditions I have seen beings in thermal springs, and sometimes things I have never seen before, sometimes things that no one has seen before and for which science had not yet found words at the time we saw them.
So I was quite moved and I wanted more.
And so I made a somewhat unusual decision.
After the success of Titanic, I said to myself, "Okay, I want to put my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on hold and become a full-time researcher for a while."
And then we started to plan these expeditions.
We dived into the "Bismarck", and explored it with robot vehicles.
We returned to the wreck of the Titanic.
We took small robots we had built to weave a fiberglass cable.
Our intention was to dive into the ship and look inside it, which had never been done before.
Nobody had ever explored the interior of the wreck, they had no funds yet, so we developed the necessary technology.
Well, I sit on the deck of the Titanic, in a diving boat, and see plank which looks very much like these boards here and which I know the band played there once.
And I fly through the passages of the ship with a small robotic vehicle.
I actually only use it, but my consciousness is inside the vehicle.
It felt as if I was physically present inside the Titanic shipwreck.
This was the most surreal form of déjà vu I have ever experienced, because before I moved around a corner, I always knew what would appear in the light cone of the vehicle, because I had been running over the film set for months while we were shooting the film.
The kit was a exact copy of the ship's plans.
So it was a very strange experience.
She made me aware of this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatars and thus transfer your consciousness into the vehicle, into this other form of existence.
It was really incredibly profound.
and perhaps also a small preview of what might happen in a few decades if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or do other things, in all kinds of post-human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan.
After these expeditions we started to really appreciate what we saw down there, for example these deep-sea springs, where we saw these incredibly astonishing animals, which are almost aliens, but here on earth.
They live by means of chemosynthesis.
They do not exist in a solar-based system, as we do.
And so you see animals which are right next to a 500 degree Celsius.
They are a very dangerous species, and they are very dangerous.
At the same time I was also interested in space science, which was again the science fiction influence of my childhood.
And so I landed with the people who are interested in space and who are involved in NASA and who sit on the NASA Scientific Council and plan real space missions.
That was fascinating.
But in the end it ended up taking space scientists with us into the deep sea.
I took them with me and gave them access to the world below: astrophysicists, planetologists, people interested in such extreme situations, I took them to the sources so that they could look around, take samples, test instruments, and so on.
We did make documentary films, but we did actually do science, more specifically space science.
This was the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan, then as a child, and the implementation into reality.
I learned a lot in the course of this voyage of discovery.
I have learned a lot about science, but I have also learned a lot about leadership style.
Now you probably think that a director must also be able to lead, be a leader like a ship captain or so.
But I didn't understand much of leadership before I started these expeditions.
At a certain point I had to say to myself: "What am I doing here?
Why do I do this, what will the result be?"
These dirty films do not make us any money.
We are playing into the production costs, and there is no sign of glory.
Everyone thinks I've run away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and shaved my nails on a towel on the beach somewhere.
I made all these films, these documentaries, for a very small audience.
No glory, no honor, no money, what do you do?
You do it for the sake of the task, for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is, you do it for the sake of discovery, and for the strange connection that a small group of people creates when a team is formed.
We did all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked together for years, sometimes for 2 to 3 months in a row.
And in this community, it is recognised that the most important thing is respect for each other because you have accomplished a task that you cannot explain to anyone else.
When you return to land and say, 'We had to do it, the fibreglass, the sound reduction, and all the rest, the whole technology, the difficulties, the human capacity to work at sea', you simply cannot explain it to others, as if you were a policeman or a soldier who has gone through something together and knows that they can never explain it to anyone.
This is where a connection, mutual respect, is created.
So when I came back to shoot my next movie "Avatar", I tried to apply the same leadership style, namely respecting your team and earning your respect in return.
This has really changed the dynamic.
So I was shooting "Avatar" with a small team on unknown terrain.
It is incredibly exciting.
This is an enormous challenge.
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years.
This completely changed my way of making films.
There were people who said that we had really made these oceans and transported them to the planet Pandora.
For me, it was more a principled way of doing my job, the real process that has changed as a result.
So what can we conclude from all this?
What lessons have we learnt?
I believe that curiosity comes first.
It is the most powerful human attribute.
Our imagination is a power that can even create a reality.
And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels of the world.
I am greeted by young filmmakers who say, 'Give me some advice on how to do this.'
And I say: 'Do not bury yourself.
They will supply it for you, but do not ask for it for yourself, do not bet against yourself, but take risks on your own.'
NASA has a favorite saying: 'failure is not an alternative'.
But in art and research, failure must be an alternative, because it guarantees a confidence guarantee.
No major undertaking that required innovation was ever tackled without risk.
You have to be prepared to take such risks.
That is the thought I would like to share with you: failure is an alternative, but fear is not.
If I could tell you one thing today, it is that the totality of the data we consume is greater than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about overloading information, I would like you to think about how we can use information in such a way that patterns emerge and we can see trends that would not otherwise have become visible.
So what we see here is a typical death chart arranged by age.
The program I am using here is a small experiment.
It is called Pivot and what I can do with Pivot is to filter for a certain cause of death, say accidents.
And immediately I see another pattern that emerges.
This is because it is in the middle classes that people are most active and they are most fragile over here.
We can go a step further and then rearrange the data and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.
If we go on and sort by age, say 40 years or younger, we see that accidents are even the main cause people should be worried about.
And anyone who goes on researching will see that this is particularly true for men.
You will therefore see that the appearance of information and data in this way is very reminiscent of swimming in a live information graph.
And if we can do this for raw data, why not for content itself?
What we have here are the cover images of every single "Sports Illustrated" ever printed.
Everything is here, everything is online.
You can test it in your rooms after my talk.
With Pivot you can dive into a decade.
You can dive into a particular year.
You can jump directly to a particular output.
When I look here, I see the athletes who appear in this edition and the sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so click here to see all the editions where Lance Armstrong is mentioned.
Now, if I just want to get a broader overview, I might think "OK, what if I look at everything about cycling?"
So I go back a step and broaden the view.
Now I see Greg Lemond.
And so you get an idea that if you search for this kind of information, more targeted, broader, zoom in, zoom out, you don't search or just surf.
You are doing something that is actually a little different.
It is something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used.
I would like to go a little further with this idea, which is a bit crazy.
What we did here is taking every single Wikipedia page and reducing it to a small summary.
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol for the area from which it comes.
I'll show you the top 500 of the most popular Wikipedia pages.
But even in this limited view we can do a lot of things.
We get an impression of the topics most popular on Wikipedia immediately.
I will now choose the subject of 'government'.
Well, after I chose 'government', I realize that the Wikipedia categories that most relate to Time Magazines are "People of the Year".
This is really important, because this is a knowledge that is not in a single Wikipedia page.
This is only visible if you take a step back and look at the whole thing.
Looking at one of these summaries, I can then go into Time Magazine's topic "People of the Year" and see all together.
When I look at all these people, I see that the majority of them are government officials, some from science, some, even less so, from the economy, where my boss is, and one from the music sector.
And interestingly, Bono is also a TED Prize winner.
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.
You see, we surf the net for the first time as if it is really a net, not just from side to side, but much more abstract.
And so I want to show you something else that might be a little surprise.
I am simply going to show you the New York Times website.
Pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring this zoom technology to every single web page like this.
So I can take a step back and jump straight to a specific section.
This is important because only by viewing web pages in this way, you can view the whole internet process in the same way.
So I can zoom in on my progression within a certain time frame.
Here is the state of the entire demonstration that I have held up to now.
And I can, so to speak, take back everything I have seen today.
And when I go out and look at everything, I can reorder my history perhaps according to my search history.
And from here I can go into the page and re-open it.
It is a metaphor that is used time and again, and every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data parts.
At the moment, in this world, we think that data is a curse.
We are talking about the curse of the excess of information.
We are talking about 'drowning in information'.
What if we could turn this situation around and turn the Internet on its head so that instead of always going from one to another, we can start going from many things to many things, thereby recognizing patterns that would otherwise have been hidden?
If we can do this, then this previous data trap will become a new source of useful information.
And, rather than simply moving around in information, we can get knowledge from it.
And when we learn knowledge, we may even learn wisdom from it.
I will stop there, thank you.
Everyone talks about happiness today.
I have asked some people to count the number of books published with the title "Happiness" in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 and there were many more.
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers.
There is a lot of coaching for happiness.
Everyone wants to make people happier.
But, despite all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that make it almost impossible to think clearly about happiness.
And my talk today will mainly deal with these cognitive traps.
This applies to lay people who think about their own happiness, and it applies to scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are as confused as anyone else.
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is a certain meaning to which we could limit it, but on the whole, this is something we must be abandoned and we will have to adopt the complicated view of what well-being is.
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory: in fact, it consists between being happy in one’s life and being happy about one’s life or happy with one’s life.
And these are two very different concepts, and they are both lumped together in the notion of happiness.
And the third is the concentration illusion, and that is the unfortunate fact that we cannot think about a circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its meaning.
I think that this is a real cognitive trap.
There is simply no way to get it right.
Now I would like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures, who told a story [unclearly...] He said he had heard a symphony and it was absolutely wonderful music, and at the very end of the recording there was a terrible crackling sound.
And then he added, really quite emotionally, that ruined the whole experience.
But it did not have that.
What it ruined were the memories of the experience.
He had had the experience.
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music.
They did not count because he had remained with a memory; the memory was ruined, and memory was all he had been given to keep.
What this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self.
There is a living self that lives in the present and knows the present, is able to relive the past, but basically only has the present.
It is the self-experiencing that the doctor addresses -- you know when the doctor asks, "Do you hurt now when I touch you here?"
And then there is a remembrance self, and the remembrance self is that which counts and maintains the history of our lives, and it is that which the doctor addresses by asking the question: 'How did you feel lately?'
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something similar.
These are two very different units, the self-experienced and the self-remembering, and confusing the two is part of the confusion of the concept of happiness.
Well, the reminding self is a storyteller.
And that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately.
We do not just tell stories when we get down to telling stories.
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we can keep from our experiences is a story.
And let me start with an example.
There is an old study.
These are real patients who are subjected to a painful procedure.
I will not go into the details, but it is no longer painful today, but it was painful when this study was carried out in the 1990s.
They were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds.
And here are two patients, these are their records.
And you are asked: 'Which of them has suffered more?'
And that is a very simple question.
Patient B clearly suffered more, his intestinal mirroring was longer, and every minute of pain that patient A had had patient B, and more.
But now there is another question: 'How much did these patients think they were suffering?'
And here is a surprise:
And the surprise is that patient A had a much worse exposure to the intestinal mirroring than patient B.
The stories of the colonoscopy were different, and because a very crucial part of the story is how it ends --
and none of these stories is very evocative or great -- but one of them is this clear... but one of them is clearly worse than the other.
And the worst was the one where the pain was at its peak at the end.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people about their digestion mirroring, and also much later: 'How bad was the whole thing?'
and it was much worse for A than for B in imagination.
Well, this is a direct conflict between the self experienced and the self remembering.
From the perspective of the experienced self, B clearly had a worse time.
Well, what could be done with patient A, and we have actually carried out clinical experiments and it has been done and it works, you could actually prolong the intestinal mirroring of patient A by simply leaving the tube in without being too sensitive to it.
This will result in the patient suffering, but only a little and much less than before.
And if you do that for a few minutes you have done that patient A's experienced self is worse off and you have done that patient A's remembering self is much better off, because now you have given patient A a better story about his experience.
What distinguishes a story?
And that applies to the stories that memory gives us and it also applies to the stories that we invent.
What distinguishes a story are upheavals, significant moments and ends.
Ends are very, very important and in this case the end dominated.
Well, the self that is experiencing lives its life continuously.
It has moments of experience, one after the other.
And you ask: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is really simple: you are lost forever.
I think most of our moments in life -- and I have calculated it -- you know that the psychological present is supposed to be about three seconds long, which means, you know, that there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime, and there are about 600 000 in a month, most of them leaving no trace.
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self.
And yet you somehow get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life.
It is the limited resource we consume while we are in this world.
And how we consume it would seem important, but that is not the history that the reminding self retains for us.
So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they are really quite different.
The biggest difference between them is how they handle time.
From the point of view of the experienced self, if you have a holiday and the second week is as good as the first, then the two-week holiday is twice as good as the one-week holiday.
This does not work at all for the memory self.
For the memory self, a two-week holiday is hardly better than a one-week holiday, because it does not add new memories.
They have not changed history.
In this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembrance self from a living self.
Well, the reminding self does more than remember and tell stories.
It is actually the person who makes decisions, because if you have a patient who has had, say, two abdominal examinations with two different surgeons and decides which one to choose, then the person who chooses is the one who has the memory which is less serious and that is the surgeon who will be chosen.
The self-experienced has no voice in this choice.
In fact, we are not choosing between experiences; we are choosing between memories of experiences.
And even when we think of the future, we do not usually think of our future as experiences.
We think about our future as foreseeable memories.
And in essence, you know, you can see this as a tyranny of the remembrance self, and you can think of the remembrance self as one that, so to speak, drags the experienced self through experiences that the experienced self does not need.
I have the impression that when we go on holiday, that is very often the case, that is, we go on holiday largely in the service of the memory self.
And that is a bit difficult to justify, I think.
I mean, how much do we learn from our memories?
This is one of the explanations given for the dominance of the remembrance self.
And when I think about it, I think of a holiday we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best holiday I had ever had, and I think about it relatively often in relation to how often I think about other holidays.
And I have probably pondered from my memories of this three-week trip, I would say about 25 minutes for the last four years.
Well, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour.
Well, that is three weeks and that is at most one and a half hours.
There seems to be some disagreement.
Well, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for drawing memories, but even if you do more of it there is a real question: Why do we give memories so much weight in comparison to the weight we give experiences?
I would therefore like you to think about an experiment in thought.
Imagine your next holiday, you know that at the end of the holiday all your pictures will be destroyed and you will get an amnesia medicine so you will not remember anything.
If you choose the same holiday, there is a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict and that is really not obvious at all, because if you think in terms of time you get an answer, and if you think in terms of memories you get another answer.
Why we choose the holidays we choose is a problem that we face with a choice between the two types of self.
Well, the two types of the self raise two terms of happiness.
There are indeed two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self.
So you can ask: How happy is the self experiencing?
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the life of the experiencing self?
And they are all -- happiness for moments is a rather complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measured?
And, by the way, we are now able to get a fairly good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
If you ask about the happiness of the remembering self, it is quite another matter.
This is not about how happy a person lives.
It is about how satisfied or happy the person is when that person thinks about his life.
A very different term.
Anyone who does not distinguish between these terms will confuse the research of happiness, and I am one of a lot of researchers on well-being who have long confused the research of happiness in precisely this way.
The distinction between the happiness of the self-experienced and the satisfaction of the self-remembered has been recognized in recent years, and now efforts are being made to measure the two separately.
The Gallup Organization has conducted a global survey in which more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts in this direction.
In recent years, we have therefore started to learn about the happiness of the two types of self.
And the main lesson we have learnt, I believe, is that they are really different.
They can know how satisfied someone is with his life, and that really does not teach them much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa.
Just to give you an impression of the correlation, the correlation is about.5.
What this means is that if you met someone and they would tell you, oh, his father is a two-meter man, how much would you know about his size?
Well, you would know about its size, but there is a lot of uncertainty.
They have so much uncertainty.
When I tell you that someone has classified his life as eight on a ten-point scale, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self.
The correlation is therefore small.
We know something about what determines the satisfaction of the happiness of the Self.
We know that money is very important, and objectives are very important.
We know that happiness means being satisfied with people we like, spending time with people we like.
There are other pleasures, but that is dominant.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self, you will end up doing very different things.
The conclusion from what I said here is that we should not really imagine happiness as a substitute for well-being.
It is a completely different term.
Well, very briefly, another reason we cannot think clearly about happiness is that we do not pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live.
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you will not get the correct answer.
If you ask this question, you think that people in California must be happier if you live, say, in Ohio.
And what happened is that when you think about life in California, you think of the difference between California and other places, and this difference is, say, in the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important for the self-experience, and it is not even very important for the thoughtful self, which determines how happy people are.
Well, because the thoughtful self is responsible, you can end up -- some people might end up moving to California.
And it is interesting to watch what happens to people who move to California in the hope of becoming happier.
Well, their living self will not become happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen: you will think you are happier because when you think about it, you will be reminded how terrible the weather was in Ohio, and you will feel that you have made the right decision.
It is very difficult to think clearly about well-being, and I hope I have given you an impression of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you, I have a question for you.
Thank you.
Well, when we telephoned a few weeks ago, you told me that there was a quite interesting result from this Gallup poll.
Is that something you can share with us because you have a few minutes left?
Daniel Kahneman: Yes.
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup poll is a figure we absolutely didn't expect to find.
We found that in terms of the happiness of the self experiencing.
If we look at how feelings vary with income.
And it turns out that under an income of $60,000 a year, for Americans, and that is a very large sample of Americans, about 600,000, but it is a large representative sample, under an income of $600,000 a year.
CA: 60.000.
DK: 60.000.
People are unhappy at $60,000 a year, and the poorer they become, the more unhappy they become.
This gives us a very flat line.
I think I have rarely seen such flat lines.
What happens is obviously that money does not bring you happiness, but that lack of money certainly brings you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In the sense of the other self, the reminding self, you get another story.
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
That does not apply to emotions.
CA: But Danny, the whole American effort is about life, freedom, the pursuit of happiness.
If people took these findings seriously, I think it seems to turn everything upside down, everything we believe, for example in relation to tax policy and so on.
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country in general, would take a finding like this seriously and make policy on it?
DK: Do you know, I believe there is recognition for the role of happiness research in politics.
Recognition will be slow in the United States, no doubt, but it is happening in the United Kingdom and in other countries.
People are beginning to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of politics.
It will take a while and people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want to explore life valuation, so we must have this discussion fairly soon.
How to increase happiness depends very much on how you think and whether you think of the remembrance self or whether you think of the experience self.
I believe that this will influence policy in the coming years.
In the United States, it is strict to measure the people’s experience happiness.
I believe that this will be part of national statistics over the next one or two decades.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this topic will, or should, be the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years.
Thank you for inventing behavioral economics.
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
Today I am speaking to you about energy and climate.
And that is perhaps somewhat surprising, because my full-time work at the Foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds, about the things we have to invent and deliver to make the poorest 2 billion living a better one.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, and, in fact, more important than for anybody else on the planet.
Climate deterioration means that their seeds will not grow for many years, that we will rain too much or too little, and that things will change in a way that their fragile environment cannot withstand.
This leads to famine, it leads to insecurity, it leads to unrest.
So climate change will be terrible for them.
In addition, the price of energy is very important for them.
The fact is that if you could reduce the price of just one thing, energy would be by far the most effective for poverty reduction.
Well, the price of energy has fallen over time.
Indeed, the progress society is based on energy progress.
The coal revolution started the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century there was a rapid fall in the price of electricity and therefore we have refrigerators, air conditioning, we can produce modern materials and so many things.
So we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
But if we reduce the price -- let us halve the price -- we will come up against a new barrier, and that barrier is carbon dioxide.
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually quite clear.
They accumulate the CO2 emitted, which leads to temperature increases, and this temperature increase has some very negative consequences, effects on the weather and perhaps worse, the indirect consequences that natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes and thus entire systems fall apart.
Well, the exact relationship between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change and where its further consequences lie, there are some uncertainties, but not many.
And there is no doubt about how serious these consequences will be, but they will be extremely serious!
I have asked the top scientists several times: 'Do we really need to get down to near zero?
Isn't half or a quarter enough?"
The answer is that until we get close to zero, the temperature will continue to rise.
That is why it is a major challenge.
It is quite different from saying that we have a 3.5 m high truck which has to come under a 3 m bridge, and that you can almost push it underneath.
This must be lowered to zero.
Well, we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tonnes.
Every American about 20 tons. People from poor countries, less than one.
On average, it is about 5 tons for everyone on the planet.
And somehow we must bring about changes that bring that down to zero.
It has been rising constantly so far.
Only various economic changes have influenced it at all and we must move from rapid growth to reduction and reduction to zero.
This equation has four factors, and a little multiplier: you have this thing on the left - CO2 - that you want to bring to zero, and that will depend on the number of people, the services that each person uses on average, the average energy for each service and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy.
So let us look at each factor individually and consider how we can get it to zero.
Probably one of these figures must come very close to zero.
Well, that is basic algebra, but let's go through it.
First of all, we have the population.
Today there are 6.8 billion people.
and it is going to 9 billion. which is going to 9 billion.
If we are very successful with new vaccines, health care and reproductive medicine, we could probably reduce that by 10% to 15%, but at the moment we are seeing a rise of 1.3 %.
The second factor is the services we use.
This includes everything, the food we eat, clothing, television, heating.
These are very good things and poverty reduction means making these services available to almost everyone on the planet.
It is great that this number is rising.
In the rich world, in the upper billion, we could make cuts and make less use, but on average this figure will rise every year and thus more than double the total number of services provided per person.
Does the homework assistant have a light at home to read the homework?
And these pupils do not have it, so they go out and read their homework under the street light.
Well, with effectiveness, the E, the energy per service, there is finally good news.
We have something that is not rising,
because of various successes in the light sector, by other car types, by new methods in building houses, There are many services whose energy consumption you can drastically reduce, dramatically reduce, 103 00:05:50,000 --&gt; 00:05:53,000 some services can be reduced by 90%.
Some individual services can be reduced by 90%.
In other services, such as the production of fertilisers, 105 00:05:56,000 --&gt; 00:05:58,000 or air traffic or air traffic, the scope for improvement is much smaller.
Overall, if we are optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of 3, or even a factor of 6.
But in the first three factors, we have now gone from 26 billion to perhaps the best 13 billion tonnes, and that is simply not enough!
So let's look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that is the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy.
The question is whether this can be reduced to zero.
If you burn coal: no.
If you burn natural gas: no.
Almost every method of producing electricity today emits CO2, except renewable energies and nuclear energy.
So what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system.
We need energy miracles.
When I use the term'miracle', I do not mean the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle, the PC is a miracle.
The Internet and its services are a miracle.
The people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders.
Normally there is no deadline for a miracle to be completed by a certain date.
Normally you are standing almost just by the side and some people come, others don't.
In this case, however, we must give it all the rage and get a miracle in a very short time.
Well, I wondered how I could really convey that?
Is there a natural illustration, a demonstration that would ignite the imagination of the people here?
I remembered last year when I brought mosquitoes and people somehow liked that.
The idea became really tangible for them, you know that there are people who live with mosquitoes.
For energy, that was what I thought.
I decided that the release of glowworms would be my contribution to the environment here this year.
Here are a few natural glowworms.
I was assured that they would not bite, and indeed they would not even leave the glass.
Well, there are all kinds of gameplay solutions like this, but they do not all bring much.
We need solutions, either one or more, which have unimaginable scalability and unimaginable reliability, and although there are many directions in which people are looking for them, I really do see only five that can meet these great demands.
I have omitted tidal wave, geothermal, fusion and biofuels.
They may be making a moderate contribution and if they do better than I expect it would be great, but my main message here is that we must work on all those five and we cannot give up on any of them because they intimidate us, because they all have significant problems.
First of all, let us look at the burning of fossil fuels, burning either coal or natural gas.
What we have to do there may seem simple, but it is not: we have to capture all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after burning, liquefy it under pressure and then store it somewhere and hope that it will stay there.
There are some pilot projects that do that at a 60%-80% level, but it will be very difficult to get it to 100%, and reaching an agreement on the storage of CO2 is a great challenge, but the biggest problem here is the storage time issue.
Who will ensure it?
Who can guarantee something which is literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste imaginable from nuclear and other things?
That is a lot of volume.
So that is a hard nut.
Next, nuclear energy.
The costs, especially in highly regulated countries, are high; the question of safety, where people really feel that nothing can go wrong, despite the human cooperation, that the fuel is not used for weapons.
And what do you do with the rubbish?
Because, although it is not very large, there are a lot of concerns.
People must feel good about it. 184 00:10:20,000 --&gt; 00:10:25,000 So three very difficult problems that might be solved.
So there are three very difficult problems which might be solved and which we should therefore work on.
I have summarised the last three of the five.
They are renewable energies, as they are often called.
And they too -- although it's great that they don't need fuel -- have some disadvantages.
Firstly, the energy density generated by these technologies is dramatically lower than that produced by power stations.
These are energy farms, which are referred to as many square kilometres, thousands of times more than a normal power station.
Moreover, these sources are intermittent:
The sun does not shine all day, nor does it shine every day, and the wind does not blow constantly.
Therefore, if you are dependent on these sources, you must have a way to get the energy even when it is not available.
So there are major price challenges here, and there are challenges in terms of transmission, for if we say, for example, that the source of energy is outside the country, you not only need the technology, but you also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where else.
And there is the problem of storage.
And to show the dimension, I looked at all the types of batteries that are produced: those for cars, computers, mobile phones, flashlights, for everything, and compared that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses, and I found that all the batteries that we now produce could store less than 10 minutes of total energy.
We therefore need a major breakthrough here, something that will be 100 % better than the approaches we have at present.
That is not impossible, but it is not so easy.
This happens when you try to bring these interrupted sources over, say, 20% - 30% of consumption.
If you want to be 100% based on it, you need an incredible miracle battery.
Well, where should we go: what is the right approach?
How do we get to the goal?
What we need are many companies working on it, hundreds of them.
In each of these five areas we need at least 100 people.
Many people will say that they are mad, but that is fine.
I believe that there are many people already engaged in this in the TED Group.
Bill Gross has several companies, among them one called eSolar which has great solar thermal technology.
Vinod Khosla invests in dozens of companies that do great things and have interesting opportunities and I try to support that.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is taking the nuclear approach.
There are some innovations in the nuclear field; modular, liquid.
Development in this industry stopped some time ago, so it is no big surprise that some good concepts are lying around.
The TerraPower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium, the one percent, the U235, we decided to burn the 99%, the U238.
That is a very crazy idea.
But in fact, we had been thinking about this for a long time, but we could never properly simulate whether it would work, but since modern supercomputers have been in existence, we can simulate it and see that: Yes, with the right materials approach, it looks like it would work.
And because you burn this 99%, the cost profile is much better.
In fact, waste is burned, and even the waste from today's reactors can be used as a propellant.
Instead of being concerned about it, you simply burn it, which is a great thing.
Uranium is consumed gradually, a bit like a candle.
You see that it is a kind of column, often called "walker wave reactor".
That really does solve the fuel problem.
Here is a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the waste, the 99%, which is taken out of the waste that is burned today, so it is called uranium that has been used up.
That impelled the U.S. for hundreds of years.
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily, you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet’s lifetime.
You know there are still many challenges, but it is an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward.
Let us consider how we should measure our success.
What should our testimony be?
Well, let us go to the goal we have to achieve and then talk about the intermediate step.
Many talk about a 80% reduction by 2050.
It is really very important that we get there.
The remaining 20% will be produced in poor countries, and still some agriculture, and hopefully forest clearance and cement will be clean by then.
So, to reach this 80%, the advanced countries, including countries like China, must completely re-engineer their electricity generation.
The other note says whether we are using zero emissions technology, whether it is used in all developed countries and we are on the way to getting it to the rest.
That is very important.
That will become a key element of this certificate.
If we go back from there, what should the 2020 record look like?
It should contain the two elements again.
We should use the effectiveness measures to get a reduction under way, because the less we emit, the smaller the total CO2 emissions and, therefore, the temperature.
But in fact, this note is just as important, or even less important, for the things we do that do not completely lead to the big reductions as the other note, which represents the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs.
We must follow these breakthroughs at full speed and we can measure that: in company figures, in pilot projects and regulatory changes.
There are many great books on this subject.
The Al Gore book "We Have the Choice" and David McKay's "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
You are going through it and creating a framework in which this can be discussed at length, because we need support from all sides.
There is something that needs to come together.
That is a wish.
A very specific wish that we invent this technology.
If you would allow me just one wish for the next 50 years, I could choose the President to give a vaccine, and I love that, or I could choose this wish, which is to invent a half-priced energy without CO2, and I would take up that wish.
It is this that has the greatest impact.
If we do not get this desire, the gap between long-term and short-term thinking people will become terrible, between the US and China, between poor and rich countries, and almost all the lives of these 2 billion will be much worse.
So what do we need to do?
What action do I call for?
We must push for more research funding.
When countries meet in places like Koppenhagen, they should not just talk about CO2.
You should discuss this innovation strategy and you would be shocked by the ridiculously small amount of money spent on these innovative approaches.
We need market incentives, carbon taxes, cap &amp; trade something that creates a price signal.
We must spread the message.
We need to conduct dialogue more rationally and more completely, and also the things that are being done by the government.
It is an important wish, but I think we can fulfil it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Just to understand TerraPower a little better -- first, can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment?
Bill Gates: To do the simulation on a supercomputer, to get all the great scientists to know what we have done, we only need a few 10 million, and even if we have tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly, we are only in the 100s million.
The difficult step is building the first reactor, finding further billions, the rules and the location of actually building the first of them.
Once the first is finished, once it runs as promised, everything is quite clear, because the economics and energy density are so different from nuclear energy as we know them.
CA: To understand it correctly: That means building deep into the ground almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel, this consumed uranium and then the process starts up and continues working downwards?
BG: Yes, you have to fill the reactor each time you refill it, so there are many people and many controls that can go wrong.
But if you have very cheap fuel, you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- and you bury it without all the complexities.
And it sits there and burns for 60 years and then it is finished.
CA: A nuclear reactor that provides a solution for waste itself.
BG: Yes, what happens to the garbage: you can let it sit -- there is much less garbage with this method -- then take it and pack it into the next reactor and burn it further.
We start by taking the waste that already exists in these cooling basin or drying vessels near the reactors, which is our starting fuel.
So what was a problem for these reactors is what we fill in our own, and that dramatically reduces the volume of waste during this process.
CA: But while you talked to various people around the world about these possibilities,
where is the greatest interest in actually implementing this kind of thing?
BG: Well, we have not yet chosen a place and there are a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that says "nuclear" in the name, there is great interest and the people of the company were in Russia, India, China... I was here and met the Energy Minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda.
I am optimistic, and you know that the French and Japanese have moved in that direction.
This is a variant of a thing that was done.
This is an important step forward, but it is like a rapid reactor and some countries have built it, so anyone who has built a rapid reactor is a candidate for our first.
CA: In your vision: timeframe and probability to really create something like this?
BG: Well, we need one of these scalable, electricity generating things, which are very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use.
This is almost the deadline that has been set for us by the environmental models that we must respect.
And, you know, TerraPower, if everything goes well, and that is a great wish, that could easily hold.
Fortunately, there are dozens of companies today and we need hundreds of companies who can offer their services, just as if their approaches work and the promotion of their pilots works.
It would be best if you could do it in several cases, because then you could use a mixture.
In any case, we need a solution.
CA: As for the big breakthroughs that can be made, is this the biggest you know?
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
It would have been without the environmental challenge, but it makes it even more important.
In the nuclear sector there are other innovative companies.
You know, we do not know their work as well as this one, but there is the modular method, which is a different approach.
There is a liquid type of reactor which seems to be a bit difficult, but perhaps they say that about us.
And so there are different, but the nice thing is that an uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as a, say, a carbon molecule and therefore, if you can deal with the problems, which are mainly the radiation, the footprint and the costs, the potential, that is, the impact on the land and other things, plays almost in its own league.
CA: If that doesn't work, what then?
Do we need to take emergency measures to try to keep the earth's temperature stable?
BG: When you get into this situation, it is as if you have eaten too much and are on the verge of a heart attack, what do you do then?
There is a research field called geoengineering which deals with various techniques to delay warming so that we could have 20 or 30 years longer to assemble.
That is just an insurance method.
Hopefully we do not need it.
Some people say that you should not work on insurance at all because it may make you lazy and you eat further because you know that the heart operation will save you.
I do not know whether that is wise when you realise the importance of this problem, but there is now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have this at your disposal if things come quicker or if this innovation takes longer than we expect.
CA: Climate skeptics: Do you have one or two sentences for the one to convince you perhaps?
BG: Well, unfortunately, the sceptics live in very different camps.
Those who make scientific arguments are very few.
Do they say that there are negative effects related to clouds that postpone things?
There are very, very few things they can say at all, of which there is a chance in one million.
The main problem here is as similar to AIDS.
You make the mistake now and you pay for it much later.
And so the idea of investing in something that you will only have later -- and that is not so clear -- is that now, when you have all kinds of urgent problems, investing in something that you will not have later -- and that the investment is not so clear. Indeed, the IPCC report is not necessarily the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world who look at the IPCC and say, okay, that's not a big drama.
The fact is that this uncertainty should concern us.
But my dream here is that if it can be done economically and at the same time eliminate CO2, the sceptics will say 'OK, I do not care that it does not emit CO2, I would almost like it to do so, but I will accept it because it is cheaper than the previous method'.
CA: And that would be your answer to the Björn Lomborg argument that if you spend all that time and energy on solving the CO2 problem, all the other goals, such as poverty reduction, the fight against malaria, and so on, suffer as a result, that it is a stupid waste of resources to invest money in it, while there are better things we can do.
BG: Well, actual research spending -- say the U.S. should spend $10 billion a year more than it does today -- is not so dramatic.
Other things should not suffer as a result.
You then get large sums of money, and sensible people can object if you have something that is not economic and try to finance it, and I think that this is where most waste is being done.
Unless you are very close to a breakthrough in costs and only finance the learning curve, I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper.
If the cut you get is a very high energy price, then only the rich can keep up.
I believe that each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifestyle.
But it is a disaster for the lower two billion.
And even Lomborg is thinking.
His new thread is now: 'Why is research not being discussed any more?'
He is still associated with the sceptic camp, because of his previous stories, but he understands that it is a very lonely group and therefore he is now making the research argument.
And that is a line of thought that I think is appropriate.
Research, it is simply crazy how little support is being given to it.
CA: Bill, I think I speak for almost all people here when I say I really hope that your wish will come true.
BG: Thank you.
I would like to tell you something that struck me a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired.
I always have my synonyms dictionary at hand when writing, but I was finished editing the text and I noticed that I never looked in my life what the word "disability" really means.
I will read the entry to you.
"Disabled", adjective: "broken, helpless, useless, destroyed, mutilated, wounded, treated, stunned, stunned, stunned, lazy, disused, tired, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped senile, elderly, pulled out of the traffic, repaired, done, brushed broken, counted, also injured, useless and weak.
Antonyme: Healthy, strong, efficient.'
I read this list out loud to a friend and I had to laugh, it seemed so ridiculous, but I only got to "redressed" and could not continue to speak, and I had to stop reading and get together after this flood of words and the emotional shock that it entailed.
Of course, it was a tired old synonym dictionary, I thought it was quite old.
but in fact it was an expense in the early 80s, when I just started primary school and began to build and shape my self-image outside my family environment, also in relation to other children and the rest of the world around me.
And thank God I didn't use a synonym dictionary at that time.
If I were to take this entry seriously, I would have been born into a world which someone like me would perceive as a person whose life could not be positive in any way, but today I am celebrated for the opportunities and adventures I have experienced.
So I immediately took a look at the online edition of 2009 and expected to find a more attractive post.
Here is the updated version of this entry.
Unfortunately, it is not much better.
In particular, the last two words in 'Near Antonyms' are 'complete' and 'healthy'.
But it is not just about words.
It is about what we think about the people we describe with these words.
It is about the values that are in these words and how we construct those values.
Our language influences our thinking and how we see the world and people around us.
Many ancient societies, including those of the Greeks and the Romans, really believed that the debate of a curse has great power, because what is said loudly can also manifest itself.
So what do we want to manifest – a disabled person or a powerful person?
Merely calling a person a child with a lack of respect could be enough to restrict them and impose ideas on them.
Wouldn't it be nicer to open doors to you?
One person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
He is called Dr Pizzutillo, an Italian American whose name, as you can imagine, most Americans could not correctly pronounce, so he was always called Dr P.
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was simply designed for working with children.
I found the time I spent in this hospital simply great – except for my physiotherapy.
I had to repeat exercises apparently interminably often with these thick elastic bandages -- in different colors -- you know, to build up my leg muscles, and I hate these bandages more than anything else.
And imagine, I even negotiated with Dr. P. as a five year old child and tried to stop these exercises, of course without success.
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises -- which were simply tiring and merciless -- and he said to me, "Wow, Aimee, you are such a strong, powerful and young girl, one day you will break one of those bands.
And if you do, I will give you a hundred dollars'.
It was a simple trick from Dr. P. to make me do the exercises I didn't want to do, with the prospect of becoming the richest five-year-old girl in the sickbay on the second floor, but he did get me to see my daily exercise horror with new eyes, so it became a new and promising experience.
And today I wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl shaped my self-image and how I could imagine myself as a strong, powerful and athletic person by nature.
This is just one example of how adults in power positions can stimulate a child’s imagination.
But, as the examples already quoted from the synonyms dictionaries prove, our language leaves no room for us to imagine what we all would like: to allow each individual to see himself as a powerful person.
Our language is lagging behind social changes, which are often caused by technological change.
From a medical point of view, one can of course say that my legs, laser surgery for visual impairments, titanium knee joints and artificial hip joints for aging bodies, which allow people to really take advantage of all their possibilities and to develop beyond the limits set by their natural destiny, not to mention social networking platforms, people allowing themselves to give their own identity, to define themselves in their own way,
and thus orient themselves worldwide to groups they choose.
So perhaps this technological change makes it clearer than ever that there has always been another truth, namely that every person can give something very special and very powerful to society, and that human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
Human ability to adapt - this is an interesting story because people keep asking me to tell you how I deal with adversities and I will admit to you something: this sentence never fit me and I have always felt very uncomfortable answering people's questions about it, and I think I'm beginning to understand why.
This sentence of dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on mastering a challenge without being influenced by the experience involved, as if my life had been so successful because I could escape the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis, or whatever people perceive me as having a disability.
But the truth is that we are changing, and of course we are shaped by the challenge, whether it is physical, emotional or even both.
And I would say that this is a good thing.
Adversities are not obstacles we have to twist in order to get better at our lives.
Adverse events are simply part of our lives.
And I tend to see adversity as my shadow.
Sometimes I see him very present, sometimes he is hardly visible, but he is always with me.
And I do not want to detract from the impact or the seriousness of a person's struggle.
In life there are adversities and challenges, and they are all too real and each person handles them differently, but the question is not whether we get away with adversities or not, but how we get away with them.
We are therefore not only responsible for protecting the people we love from disasters, but also for preparing them to cope with them.
And we are not doing our children any favours by giving them the feeling that they cannot adapt.
Two things must be clearly separated: on the one hand, the medical fact of being amputated and, on the other, the social opinion about whether or not I am disabled.
And, to be honest, the only real and permanent disability I have had to deal with is that the world constantly thinks it can describe me with these definitions.
In our desire to protect the people we care about and tell them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis, or even a prognosis of the quality of life they expect, we must be careful not to lay the foundations for someone being really disabled.
Perhaps the current concept, which only looks at what is broken in one and how we repair it, is a greater disability for each individual than pathology itself.
If we do not treat a person in a holistic way, and do not appreciate and acknowledge all his or her powers and opportunities, we will create another disease in addition to the natural struggle that they may have to fight.
We are degrading a person who has a value for our society.
So we need to look beyond pathology and focus on all areas of human possibilities.
Most importantly, there is a connection between our perception of our inadequacies and our great inventiveness.
We should not devalue or deny these challenging times, we should not try to avoid them, nor should we sweep them under the carpet, but rather we should recognise opportunities in the adversities.
I might rather be concerned about making it clear that we do not necessarily have to overcome adversity, but that we are open to embrace it, to take it in our lap, to use a fight expression and perhaps even to dance with it.
And perhaps we can see adversity as something natural, harmonious and useful, and thus feel less burdened by its presence.
This year we are celebrating the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago, Darwin, in my view, pointed out something very true in the human character.
I would put it like this: it is not the strongest of his kind that survives, nor is it the most intelligent of his kind, but rather the one who can adapt best to changes.
Creativity comes from conflict.
It is not only from Darwin’s work that we know that the human ability to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflict.
So, once again, change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man.
And perhaps we will only know from what wood we are carved when we are really tested.
Perhaps that is precisely the sense of adversity, a perception of the self, a feeling of our own strength.
We can give ourselves something in this way.
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond hard times.
Perhaps we can see adversity as change.
Adverse events are a change to which we have not yet adapted.
I believe that the greatest damage we have done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal.
To be honest, who is normal?
There is no normal.
They are a very ordinary person, but not the normal one.
I do not think so.
It would be great if we could exchange this pattern of thinking of normality for another of the possibilities or strength, to put it a little more dangerously, so that we can free up the powers of a very large number of children and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society.
Anthropolgists have found out that we humans have always asked the members of our society to be useful and contribute.
There are indications that the Neanderthals already carried elderly people and people with severe physical injuries 60,000 years ago, perhaps because the experience of these people's struggle for survival was valuable to society:
They did not consider these people to be broken and useless; they were treated as something special and valuable.
A few years ago, in the city I grew up in, I went to a food market in the Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania and I was standing in front of a bucket of tomatoes.
It was summer and I was wearing shorts.
And I hear a guy behind me saying, 'Well, if that is not Aimee Mullins'.
I turned around and saw this elderly man, I had no idea who he was.
I said, 'Sorry Sir, do we know each other, I cannot remember you'.
And he said: 'Well, you may not remember me.
When I first saw you, I took you out of your mother's belly'.
Oh, so they.
And of course it clicked.
That was Dr. Kean, a man I only knew from my mother's accounts about that day, because of course, quite typical, I came two weeks late on my birthday.
My mother's doctor for prenatal diagnostics was on holiday and so my parents did not know the man who gave birth to me at all.
And because I was born without a leg, and my feet were aligned with them, and I had only a few toes on one and a few toes on the other, he was the messenger, this stranger had to carry the bad news.
He said to me: 'I had to tell your parents that you would never walk, and never be as mobile as other children, or that you would never live an independent life, and since then you have simply lied to me.'
I found it really extraordinary that he collected newspaper excerpts from my entire childhood, whether I had won a second-class bookbinding contest, whether I was walking with the Scouts at the Halloween parade, whether I had won my scholarship or one of my sporting victories, and he used these excerpts to teach his students, medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
And he called this part of his course the X factor, the potential of human will.
It cannot be emphasised enough how crucial this factor can be for a person's quality of life.
And Dr Kean continued to tell us, he said, 'I have learned that if children are not constantly told something different, and even if they are given only a little support, if children are left to their own devices, then children can achieve a great deal.'
Look, Dr Kean has changed his thinking.
He understood that medical diagnosis and how someone handles it are two different things.
And I too have changed my thinking over time, if at the age of 15 they had asked me if I would have exchanged my prostheses for legs made of meat and bone, I would not have hesitated for a second.
I wanted to look normal at that time.
If you ask me about that today, I am not so sure.
And that happened because I experienced something with my legs and not because of those experiences.
And perhaps this change could also happen because I met so many people who opened doors to me, rather than people who wanted to restrict me or impose an idea on me.
You see, it really only takes a person to demonstrate how you can manifest your strengths and you are done.
If you allow someone to activate his own inner powers – the human mind is so receptive – if you do that and open a door to someone at a crucial moment, then you are a very good teacher for those people.
They teach them to open doors to themselves.
The real meaning of the word 'educate' is rooted in the word 'educe'.
It means producing something that is in one, unlocking the potential.
Once again, what potential do we want to tap?
In the 1960s, a case study was conducted in the UK, where secondary schools were converted into primary schools.
They call it "streaming trials" in the USA we call it "tracking".
Students are divided into grades.
And the A students are tested more intensively, get the better teachers, etc.
They then gave students with a "sufficient" the rating "very good" for a period of three months, told them they were Aces, that they were very clever, and after these three months they really did write a "one".
And of course it tears one's heart to hear that the one-person students were told conversely that they were only sufficient.
And that was the same after the three months.
But only those who were still in school – apart from the pupils who had missed school.
The most important thing in this study was that the teachers were not ordained.
The teachers did not know that something had changed.
They were simply told that they were the single students and that the students with the grade were sufficient, and they taught them and treated them just as they did.
The only real disability is a broken mind a mind that has been broken, no hope any more, no more attractive anything, no more our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability of imagination.
But if we manage to support the human spirit in continuing to hope to be beautiful to ourselves and others around us, curious and imaginative, then we are really using our energies positively.
If a spirit has these qualities, we can create a new reality and new forms of existence.
I would like to end with a poem written by a Persian poet called Hafiz in the 14th century, which my friend Jacques Dembois told me about, and it is called 'The God who knows only four words'. 'Every child knows God, not the God of names, not the God of prohibitions, but the God who knows only four words and repeats them constantly, always saying: come, dance with me'.
Come and dance with me.
How would you want to be better than you are at the moment?
Suppose I said that, by a few changes in your genes, could have a better memory -- more precise, accurate, and faster.
Or would you like to be fitter, stronger, more powerful.
Do you want to become more attractive and more confident?
How about living longer in good health?
Or perhaps you are one of those who always longed for more creativity.
Which would you like most?
What would you like to have if you could have only one?
Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Please lift your hands and let me see.
A few, probably as many as there are creative people here.
That is very good.
How many would opt for a good memory?
A few more.
How about fitness?
A few less.
What about longevity?
I would like to see that as a doctor.
If you could have just one of them, it would be a completely different world.
Is all this just imagination?
Or is it perhaps possible?
Evolution has been a continuing topic here at the TED conference, but today I would like to give you the view of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communitarian in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay entitled "Nothing in biology makes no sense except in the light of evolution."
Well, if you are one of those who do not accept the evidence of biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take your personal communication device - I give you permission - and perhaps you can still take a look at Kathryn Schultz's book, which is about being wrong, because nothing in the further course of this speech will make any sense to you.
But if you accept biological evolution, consider this: is it only about the past, or is it about the future as well?
Is it valid for others or does it affect us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
In this picture, I put a bush as a center of branching in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, all existing species at the tips of these branches have had success in evolutionary terms: they have survived; it has demonstrated fitness and strength to its surroundings.
The human part of this buoy, far at the end, is of course what we are most interested in.
We trace a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In this period, there were perhaps 20 or 25 different species of humans.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It seems as if we are quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life, but actually for the most part, the basic mechanisms of our cells are quite similar.
Do you realize that we can benefit from this and require the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin used to treat diabetics?
This is not like human insulin; it is the same protein, it is chemically indistinguishable from what comes from the pancreas.
And while we are talking about bacteria, are you aware that each of us has more bacteria in our intestines than it has cells in the rest of our body?
Perhaps 10 times as many.
I mean, think when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image, do you think about the bacteria?
Our intestines are a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria.
It is warm, it is dark, it is damp, it is very comfortable.
And you will offer you all the nutrients you could wish for without any effort on your part.
It is really an easy way for bacteria, with occasional interruptions of unintended, however forced to push to the exit.
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for these bacteria, just as they are important for your life.
They help digest essential nutrients and protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we in some kind of evolutionary balance in the form of a species?
Or are we destined to become something else - something that is perhaps even better adapted to the environment?
Let us take a step back to the Big Bang of 14 trillion years ago -- the earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years ago - the first signs of living beings, perhaps three to four billion years ago on the earth - the first multi-cellular organisms, perhaps as many as 800 or one billion years ago - and then the human species, which is finally developing over the last 130 000 years.
In this huge unfinished symphony of the universe, life on the earth is measured only briefly; the animal world, like a single chord; and human life, a small decoration of notes.
That was our case.
This is also the entertainment value of this speech, so I hope you like it.
Well, when I was a newcomer to college, I had my first biology courses.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I found something very fundamental: in most the existence of life in individual organisms, each cell divides, and all the genetic information of the cell is kept in both daughter cells.
But as multi-cell organisms appeared, things began to change.
Sexual reproduction is coming into play.
And most importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction, which passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes indispensable.
In fact, one could say that the inevitable death of our body in evolution occurs at the same moment as sexual reproduction.
Now I have to admit, when I was a college student, I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex - it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year, it has come to my growing doubts.
I have come to understand the feelings of George Burns, who performed his show in Las Vegas in the 1990s.
And one night, there is a knock at his hotel room door.
He opens the door.
In front of him stands a beautifully scarcely dressed showgirl.
She looks at him and says, 'I'm here for super sex'.
"That's great," George says, "I'll take the soup."
I came to the conclusion as a doctor that I was working towards an objective that was different from the objective of evolution - not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I tried to keep the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore my health after an illness.
I wanted to lead a long and healthy life.
Evolution is all about the transfer of the genome to the next generation, adaptation and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are designed like booster rockets to send the genetic cargo to the next stage of the orbit to fall into the sea.
I think we would all understand the mood expressed by Woody Allen when he said: "I do not want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it by not dying."
Evolution does not necessarily mean having the longest life.
It does not necessarily favour the biggest, the strongest or the fastest, nor even the smartest.
Evolution privileges the creatures that best adapt to your environment.
It is only the test of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean there are bacteria that are thermophilic and therefore survive the hot steam otherwise if fish were there it would result in vacuum cooked fish but they have managed to make a habitable environment for themselves.
So what does that mean when we look back at what is happening in evolution and how we think about the place of humans in evolution, and above all how we look forward to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not develop.
We have achieved some kind of balance.
And the reasons for this would be that firstly, through medicine, we have succeeded in keeping a lot of genes that would otherwise have been selected and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species we have configured our environment in such a way that we have managed to make it adapt to us exactly as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we migrate and circulate and mix so much that you can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to take place.
A second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional kind, naturally, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly grinding but they are relentless.
And as far as isolation goes, if we as a species colonize distant planets, there will be isolation and the changes in the environment that evolution could naturally produce.
But there is a third possibility, a tempting, fascinating and frightening possibility.
I call it neo-evolution - the new development that is not simply natural but guided and decided by us as individuals in the decisions we make.
Well, how could that happen?
How could it have been possible for us to do this?
Let us first consider the reality that people today, in some cultures, make decisions about their descendants.
They are, in some cultures, the choice to have more men than women.
It is not necessarily good for society, but it is what the individual and the family decide.
Think, if it were not only possible to choose the sex of your child, but also to make genetic adjustments to the body, which would cure and prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic modifications to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's, or to reduce the risk of cancer or stroke?
Would you not want to make these changes in your genes?
If we look ahead, this type of change will become increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and lasted 13 years.
It cost $2.7 billion.
The next year, when it was finished in 2004, you could do the same thing for $20 million in three to four months.
Today you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about $ 20,000 and in space of about a week.
It will not be long before the reality will be that there will be the $1,000 human genome, and it will increasingly be available to everyone.
A week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded the Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and produce desirable proteins in a more efficient way - which Frances Arnold calls "direct evolution".
A few years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating only four genes, he produced the cell to turn it into a pluripotent stem cell - a cell potentially able to become any cell in your body.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that can serve not only as protection against themselves, but also as immunity against other viruses.
Whether you believe it or not, there is an experimental study under way with influenza vaccine which has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco?
This is all a reality today and much more will be possible in the future.
Just imagine two other small changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells of your descendants?
What if you could change the sperm and eggs or the newly fertilised egg to give your children a better chance for a healthier life - eliminate diabetes, eliminate haemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who does not want healthier children?
And then the analytical technique, the same engine of science that can allow changes to prevent disease, could also allow us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities - better memory.
Why not have the sensitivity of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the fast muscle fibres that will allow you to run faster and longer?
Why not live any longer?
These will be irresistible.
And when we are at a point where we can pass it on to the next generation and adopt the attributes we want, we will be transformed from old-style evolution to neo-evolution.
We will have a process that usually takes 100,000 years, and we can compress it to a thousand years - and perhaps even the next 100 years.
These are decisions that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, will have to avoid.
Are we using these decisions to build a better, more successful, more friendly society?
Or will we selectively select different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others?
Will we shape a society that is bored and uniformed, or more robust and versatile?
These are the kinds of questions we will have to face.
And, most of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom we will need to make these decisions wisely?
In good and bad ways, and earlier than you might think, these decisions will be up to us.
Thank you.
I would like you to imagine something now, a portable robot that gives you superhuman skills, or another that helps wheelchair users get up and walk again.
At Berkeley Bionics we call these robots Exoskelettes.
They are nothing more than something you put in in the morning and that will give you additional strength and will further increase your speed and help you to maintain your balance, for example.
This is indeed the true fusion of man and machine.
But not only that -- meld and network with the universe and other devices out there.
This is not just a crazy idea.
To show you now what we are working on, we start by talking about the American soldier who, on average, carries around 100 pounds on his back and there is a request that they should wear more equipment.
Of course, this leads to some significant complications -- back injuries, 30 percent of which -- chronic back injuries.
So we thought we were going to take up this challenge and create an exoskelet that would help deal with this problem.
So let me present HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier.
Soldier: With the HULC exockeleton I can carry 200 pounds over various terrain for many hours.
Its flexible design allows you to kneel, crawl and perform extremely agile movements.
It feels what I want to do, where I want to go and then increases my strength and endurance.
We are ready to introduce this device, this new exoskelette, with our industrial partner this year.
It is true.
Let us now look at the wheelchair, something I am particularly keen on.
There are 68 million people estimated worldwide in wheelchairs.
This is about one percent of the total population.
And that is indeed a conservative estimate.
We often talk about very young people with spinal fractures who were hit by fate during their heyday - the age of 20, 30 or 40 - and the wheelchair is the only option.
But there is also the issue of the ageing population, whose number is increasing.
And almost the only option -- if it is a brain damage or other complications -- is a wheelchair.
And that is how it has been for 500 years, since its introduction, I must say, with great success.
We thought, therefore, that we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area of mobility.
Let me now present eLEGS, worn by Amanda Boxtel, who suffered a spinal injury 19 years ago, which has resulted in her not being able to walk for 19 years and until now.
Thank you.
As I said, Amanda wears our eLEGS.
It has sensors --
its fully non-invasive sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer, which is attached here on their back.
Here are also battery packs, the motor drive is located on their hips and on their knee joints, which move them forward in this quite smooth and very natural way of walking.
I was 24 years old and in the best shape when a monstrous root tree paralyzed me during a ski run.
In a fraction of a second I lost every feeling and every movement under my basin.
Not long afterwards, a doctor stepped into my sick room and said, 'Amanda, you will never be able to go again'.
And that was 19 years ago.
He stole every ounce of hope from my consciousness.
Since then, adaptable technologies have enabled me to learn to ski again, to climb and even to ride a bike with my hands.
But nothing has been invented that would let me go again, until now.
Thank you.
As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to meet and discuss with you.
It is in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.
Thank you.
At home in New York, I am the head of the development department of a non-profit organization called Robin Hood.
If I do not fight poverty, I fight fire as a helper of a fire brigade in a voluntary fire brigade.
Well, in our town, where volunteers supported a highly qualified professional fire brigade, you have to be quite early at the fire to get involved.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer at the fire station, so I had a good chance of getting in.
But it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the captain responsible and find out what our tasks would be.
When I found the captain, he had just had a very serious conversation with the housewife, who certainly had one of the worst days of her life.
It was in the middle of the night and she was standing barefoot under a shelter in the rain, while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had just arrived before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- reached the captain first and was asked to go into the house and save the owner's dog.
I was speechless with envy.
There was some lawyer or asset manager who could tell people for the rest of his life that he went to a burning house to save a living being just because he was five seconds faster than me.
Well, I was the next.
The captain winked me to himself.
He said,'Bezos, you have to go to the house.
You must go up, pass the fire and get this woman a pair of shoes.'
I swear it.
Well, not exactly what I had hoped for, but I went up the stairs, along the hall, past the "real" firemen, who were quite ready to fire at the time, to go into the bedroom to pick up a pair of shoes.
I know what you are thinking now, but I am not a hero.
I carried my prey back down, where I met my arch enemy and my beloved dog at the front door.
We took our treasures out to the house owner, where, no surprise, his attention was much greater than mine.
A few weeks later, the fire brigade received a letter from the house owner, thanking her for her brave efforts in rescuing her house.
A very much appreciated kindness: someone even brought her a pair of shoes.
Both in my job as Robin Hood and in my secondary job as a volunteer fireman, I witness generosity and kindness on a large scale, but I also see the actions of charity and courage of individuals.
And do you know what I learned?
They are all important.
So when I look around this room and see people who have either already achieved a remarkable success or are on their way to achieving it, I would like to offer the following reminder: do not wait.
Do not wait to make a difference in the lives of others until you reach your first million.
If you have something to give, give it now.
Serving in a soup kitchen, renting a park in the neighborhood, swimming pool, sauna, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool,
be a mentor.
Not every day will give us an opportunity to save a person's life, but every day offers us the opportunity to change one.
So get on with it; save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Guissani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Thank you.
I have just returned from a community that knows the secret of the survival of mankind.
A place where women lead the sceptre, say 'hello' with sex, and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious matter.
And no, it is not Burning Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, your kinship.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the jungle of the Congo.
Bonobos are our nearest living relatives, together with chimpanzees.
This means that we have a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago.
Well, chimpanzees are known for their aggressiveness.
But, unfortunately, we have overemphasized this aspect in the story of human evolution.
But Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees are run by big, fearsome boys, the Bonobo Society is run by empowered females.
They have really made a mistake, because it leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence has not been observed.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least well-known primates.
They live in the depths of the Congolese primeval forest and are difficult to observe.
The Congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed almost as many lives as the First World War.
It is no surprise that this destruction also endangers the survival of the bonobos.
Meat trade and the decline in the trees mean that you couldn't even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even then we're not sure to be honest.
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, one can hear a hidden laughter that shakes the trees.
Who are these relatives?
We know them as "love rather than war" apes, because they have frequent, even bisexual sex, with changing partners, and thus settle conflicts and social matters.
I am not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of the Bonobos consists of more than Kama Sutra.
Bonobos -- like humans -- love to play for their life.
Game is not just child's play.
For us and them, play is fundamental for the binding of relationships and the nurturing of tolerance.
In doing so, we learn confidence and the rules of the game.
Game increases creativity and endurance, and it is primarily about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you observe Bonobos playing, you see the evolutionary origins of human laughter, dance and ritual.
Game is the stick that keeps us together.
Well, I don't know how you play, but I would like to show you some unique shots from the wild.
First a ball game in Bonobo style -- and I don't think of football.
So here we see a young female and a male in a chase game.
Look at what it is doing.
This might be the evolutionary origin of "it picks it from the eggs."
Just that I think it is more like him, no?
Yes!
Sex games are therefore common, both among bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- And this video is really interesting because it shows the ingenuity with which new elements are introduced -- like the testicles -- and also how the game both requires and promotes trust -- while at the same time making a huge fun.
But the game is a shaper.
Game is a shape changer and it can take many shapes, some of which are quieter, imaginative, curious -- perhaps to rediscover the surprise.
And I would like to show you that this is Fuku, a young female, and she plays peacefully with water.
I think, just like them, we sometimes play on our own and we explore the boundaries of our internal and external worlds.
And it is this playing curiosity that makes us research and interact, and the unexpected links we make are the real breeding ground of creativity.
This is just a small foretaste of the insights that Bonobos give us into our past and present.
But they also remain a secret for our future, a future in which we must adapt to increasing challenges, through greater creativity and through increased cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these skills.
In other words, game is our adjustment joker.
To successfully adapt to an unstable world, we must play.
But will we make the most of our gambling pleasure?
Game is not stupid,
but essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just about teeth and paws.
When it hardly seems appropriate, games are perhaps the most necessary.
And therefore, my primate companions, let us embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, camaraderie and amazement.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples, in mid 1979, on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each bearing a baby -- okay.
So two couples, each giving birth to a baby.
Now I do not want you to spend too much time imagining the conception of conception because if you imagine the conception of conception all the time, you will not listen to me.
Just imagine that for a moment.
In this scenario, imagine that in one case the sperm carries a Y phosphosomal cell which hits the X chromosome of the egg cell.
And in the other case, the sperm carries an X chromosome which meets the X chromosome of the egg cell.
Both are viable, both are combustible.
We will come back to these people later.
In most of my activities I wear two hats.
Under one hat I am dealing with the history of anatomy.
I am a historian and in this case I investigate how people handled anatomy -- human bodies, animal bodies -- how they handled body fluids, body concepts; how they thought about bodies.
The other hat I have worn in my work is that of the activist, as patient lawyer -- or, I sometimes say, as impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors.
In this case, I have worked with people who have body types that call social norms into question.
For example, I have worked with people who are Siamese twins, two people in one body.
I worked with people with dwarf growth -- people who were smaller than usual.
And very often I have worked with intersexual people whose gender is atypical -- people who do not have the average male or female body types.
And as a general term we can use the word intersexuality.
Intersexuality comes in many different forms.
I will give you just a few examples of the possible types of gender variants that do not correspond to the male or female standard.
In one case, you may have someone with a XY chromosome base, and the SRY gene of the Y phosphosomal gene allows the protogonades that we all have at foetal stage to grow to testicles.
And that is why the testicles in the foetal stage release testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the receptors to detect testosterone, the body does not react to testosterone.
And that is called an androgen receptor defect.
So much testosterone, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops more in line with the typical female progression.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl, and she is educated as a girl.
But it usually takes until she reaches puberty and her breasts grow and develop, but she doesn't get her period until someone comes to realize that something is different here.
And they do some tests and find out that instead of having eggs and uterus, she actually carries testicles and that she has a Y chromosome.
It is important to understand that this person might be considered to be male, but they are not really.
Women, like men, have something in our bodies called adrenalin glands.
They are located in the back part of our body.
And the adrenals produce androgens, which are a lipid-producing hormone.
Most women, like me -- I think I'm a typical woman -- I don't know my actual chromosome structure, but I think I probably have the typical one -- most women like me actually talk about androgens.
We produce androgens and we talk about androgens.
As a result, someone like me actually has a brain that has been exposed to more androgens than a woman born with testicles and has an androgen receptor defect.
So gender is really complicated; intersexuals are not only in the middle of the gender spectrum -- in a sense, they can be spread over the whole range,
I would like to give you one more example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19-year-old man who was born a boy, raised as a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, lived as a man and had just found out that he had ovaries and an uterus.
He had an extreme form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He has XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenals were so active that they essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, his genitals became masculine, and his brain was exposed to the more typical male part of the hormonal spectrum.
And when he was born he looked like a boy - no one suspected anything.
And only when he was 19 years old did he get enough medical problems, actually because he was menstruating internally that the doctors found that he was internally female.
Okay, just a quick example of a variant of intersexuality.
Some people with XX chromosomes develop something called ovostetis, where ovarian tissue is covered by Hodge tissue.
We do not know exactly why this is happening.
Gender can therefore be present in many different variants.
The reason why children with this type of body -- whether they are dwarfs or Siamese twins, or intersexual -- are often adapted by surgeons to the norm is not because it would be beneficial to their physical health.
In many cases, these people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why various types of surgery are often performed on them is because they threaten our social categories.
Typically, our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical characteristic is associated with a certain identity.
So we have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity; being a black person means, supposedly, having an African anatomy in relation to one's own history.
So we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we are confronted with a body that is really something very different to us, we are confused about these categorizations.
So we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture.
And our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Now imagine how astonishing it is when children are born who are two people in a body,
Where I have seen the most excitement recently was the South African runner Caster Semenya last year, whose gender was called into question at the World Lesbian Pride Competition in Berlin.
Many journalists called me and asked me, 'What test will they do to tell us whether Caster Semenya is a woman or a man?'
And I had to explain to the journalists that this test does not exist.
We now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature does not draw a line between male and female, or between male and intersexual and female and intersexual; in fact, it is we who claim that this line of division is natural.
So we have a situation where, as our science advances, we have to admit that these categories, which we thought were stable anatomical categories, which created very simple attributions in order to create lasting categories of identity, are much less sharp than we thought.
And that does not only apply to gender.
It also applies to race, which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has allowed.
In our thoughts we get into all kinds of uncomfortable areas.
We are struck, for example, by the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
What should we do with the fact that we are only different from them by a few nuclear bits?
As we push our science further, we are increasingly coming into a zone of unease, where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we have probably had are too simplistic.
We see this in all kinds of areas of human life.
One of the areas in which we see this as an example, in our current culture, in the United States today, is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life.
We have difficult discussions about when a body becomes a human being, so that it has a different right from foetal life.
Today, we have very difficult debates -- perhaps not as open as in medicine -- about when someone is dead.
Our ancestors never had such a difficult time fighting the question of when someone was dead.
They have held a pen under someone's nose at most, and when it has moved, they have not buried it.
If she did not move, she was buried.
But today we are in a situation where we want to take people's vital organs and transplant them to other people.
As a result, we are getting bogged down in the fight over the really difficult question of when someone is dead, and that leads us into a really difficult situation where we no longer have as simple categories as we used to have.
Now you might imagine that the whole collapse of categories would make someone like me really happy.
I am politically progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
I am anxious to realise that these categories are really much more uncertain than we thought.
And it makes me anxious about thinking about democracy.
So, to tell you about this tension, I must first admit that I am a great fan of the founding fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexists, but they were great.
I think they were so brave and strong, and so radical in what they did that every few years I get myself watching the narrow musical 1776, and it is not because of the music, which is absolutely forgotten.
It is because of what happened to the founding fathers in 1776.
In my view, the founding fathers were the original anatomical activists, and that is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept, and they replaced it with another that was radical and beautiful, and that was crucial for us for 200 years.
As you all recall, our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy, and monarchy was basically based on a very simplified concept of anatomy.
The rulers of the old world did not have a concept based on DNA, but they did have a concept of the birthright.
They had a blue blood concept.
They believed that people who had political power should have that political power, because of the inherited bloodline from grandfather to father to son, and so on.
The founding fathers rejected this idea and replaced it with a new anatomical concept, which said that all humans were created with equal value.
They levelled the field and decided that anatomically, the commons counted, not the differences, and that was very radical.
Now they did so partly because they were part of an enlightenment system in which two things grew together.
Democracy grew, but at the same time science grew.
If you look at the history of the founding fathers, it is clear that many of them were very interested in science and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world.
They went away from supernatural explanations, and rejected things like a supernatural concept of power, where transmission is based on a very vague concept of birthright.
They moved towards a naturalist concept.
And if you look at the Declaration of Independence, for example, you talk about nature and the God of nature.
They do not talk about God and the nature of God.
You talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as part of this they gave us a concept that was concerned with anatomical similarities.
And in doing so, they have really wonderfully prepared the future civil rights movement.
They did not think so, but what they did for us was great.
So what happened years later?
For example, women who sought the right to vote used the concept of the founding fathers, which says that anatomical commonality is more important than anatomical difference, and said, 'that we have an uterus and eggs is not important as a difference enough that we should not have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc, etc.'
Women argued this successfully.
Next came the successful civil rights movement, where we saw people like Sojourner Truth laughing about 'Am I not a woman?'
We find men in the marching lines of the civil rights movement who say, 'I am a man'.
Again, people of different skin colours who claim anatomical similarities over anatomical differences, again, successful.
We see the same thing in the disability movement.
Of course, the problem is that as we begin to look at all the similarities, we must begin to question why we keep certain divisions.
Well, I would like to maintain certain divisions, anatomically speaking, in our culture.
I do not want to give a fish, for example, the same rights as a human being.
I do not want to say that we should avoid the anatomy.
I do not want to say that 5-year-olds should have the right to consent to sex or to marriage.
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and which I think we should keep.
But the challenge is to try to find out which ones they are, why we keep them, and whether they are useful.
So let’s come back to these two beings who were witnessed at the beginning of the lecture.
We have witnessed two beings, both in mid 1979 on the exact same day.
Let us imagine that one of them, Maria, was born three months early, that is to say on 1 June 1980.
Heinrich, on the other hand, is born on the date of his birth, i.e. on 1 March 1980,
Only because Maria was born 3 months prematurely, she gains all possible rights three months before Henry -- the right to have agreed sex, the right to choose, the right to drink.
Heinrich has to wait for all this, not because he actually has a different biological age, only because of the time of his birth.
We also find other curiosities about what their rights are.
Heinrich, since he is assumed to be male -- although I did not tell you that he was the one with XY -- since he is assumed to be male, he can now be taken in, which is not something that Maria should worry about.
Maria, on the other hand, cannot enjoy the same right as Henry has in all states, namely the right to marry.
Henry can marry a woman in any state, but Maria can only marry a woman in a few states today.
We therefore have these permanent anatomical categories which are problematic and questionable in many respects.
And for me the question is: what are we going to do when our science is making such advances in anatomy that we are going to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could fall apart?
I do not want to give up science, but at the same time it sometimes feels as if science is taking itself on.
So where do we go from here?
It seems as if our culture is adopting a sort of pragmatic attitude: 'Well, we have to draw a line somewhere, so we draw it somewhere'.
But a lot of people are caught up in a very peculiar position.
So, for example, Texas decided at one point that when you marry a man you do not have a Y chromosome, and when you marry a woman you do have a Y chromosome.
In practice, people are not tested for their chromosomes.
But it is also very bizarre, because of the story I told them about the androgen receptor defect at the beginning.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us some sort of solution in his 'I Have a Dream speech'.
He says that we should not judge people by 'their skin colour, but by the characteristics of their character', and so goes beyond anatomy.
And I would say,'Yes, that sounds like a really good idea'.
But how do we do that in practice?
How do you judge people on their character?
I would also like to point out that I am not sure that we should distribute rights in relation to people in this way, because I have to admit that I know a number of Golden Retrieves who probably deserve social security more than some people I know.
I would add that I probably also know some bright Labrador dogs that are more able to make more informed, intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relations than some 40-year-olds I know.
So how are we to operationalize the question of character characteristics?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And some of me wonder what if the content of a personality were something that could be machine readable in the future -- visible by FMRI?
Do we really want to go in that direction?
I am not sure where we are going.
What I know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the US is leading in thinking about democracy issues.
In our quest for democracy, we have done our job very well, and I think we would do our job well in the future.
We do not have the situation, as is the case in Iran, for example, where a man who feels sexually attracted to other men is punished with death unless he is prepared to undergo gender conversion, in which case he can stay alive.
We do not have such situations.
I am glad to say that we do not have these conditions -- a surgeon I spoke to a few years ago who brought a couple of Siamese twins with him to separate them, partly to make a name for themselves.
But when I telephoned him and asked him why he was doing these operations -- they were highly risky operations -- his answer was that in his country, these children would be treated very poorly and he had to do it.
I replied, 'Well, you considered political asylum rather than an operation to separate them?'
The United States offers incredible opportunities to allow people to be the people they are without having to change for the sake of the state.
I therefore believe that we must lead the way.
Well, just to finish, I would like to say that I have spoken a great deal about the fathers.
And I would like to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or have looked like, if we had involved mothers more.
And I would like to say something that is somewhat radical for a feminist, namely that there could be different types of insights that come from different types of anatomy, especially when people apply group thinking.
For years, because I was interested in intersexuality, I have also been interested in research into gender difference.
And one of the things I found really interesting was the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world.
What we have learned from cross-cultural studies is that women, on average -- not everyone, but on average -- tend to pay a great deal of attention to complex social relations and care for people vulnerable within the group.
And therefore, when we think about this, we have an interesting situation ahead of us.
Years ago, when I was studying in a post-graduate degree, one of my advisors, who knew my interest in feminism -- I thought I was a feminist, and still am -- asked me a really peculiar question.
He said, 'Tell me what is female in feminism'.
And I thought, "Well, that's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is about dismantling stereotypes about gender, so nothing is feminine about feminism.
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought that there might be something feminine in feminism.
This means that there might be something, on average, that makes female brains different from male brains, which makes us more attentive to highly complex social relations and more attentive to protecting the vulnerable.
So where the founding fathers were extremely anxious to find out how individuals could be protected from the state, it is possible that if we introduce more mothers into this concept, we might get more concept of not only how to protect, but how to care for each other.
And perhaps that is where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy -- less thinking about the individual body as regards identity, and more thinking about relationships.
So when we as a people try to establish a more perfect connection, we think about what we can do for each other.
Thank you.
I am Jessi and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I have in it, I will make a very public confession, and that is: I am obsessed with outfits.
I love to find, wear, and recently photograph and blog a different colorful, crazy outfit at every opportunity.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my second hand clothes from flea markets and second hand shops.
Ooh, thank you very much.
Second hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my wardrobe on the environment and also on my wallet.
I meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually serve a good purpose; I look pretty unique; and shopping makes me a personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what will I find today?
Will it have my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it cost less than $20?
If all the answers are yes, I feel like I have won.
I come back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does someone bring with so many outfits?
So I will show you exactly what I brought with me.
I brought seven pairs of underwear and that is all.
Underwear for exactly one week is all I have done in my suitcase.
I bet that if I first came to Palm Springs I would find everything else I wanted to wear.
And since you didn’t hear of me as the woman walking around here at TED in her underwear – that means I found a few things.
And I would like to show you my outfits for this week.
Is that good?
As I do so, I will also give you some of the lessons I have learned from these adventures, whether you believe it or not, not to wear anything new.
Let us start with Sunday.
I call that the shining tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look great for less than $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me 55, and it was the most expensive piece I wore this week.
Monday: Color is something powerful.
It is almost impossible to be ill-fated when wearing light red trousers.
When you are happy, you attract other happy people.
Tuesday: Adjustment is totally overvalued.
I have spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time adapting.
Be just who you are.
If you surround yourself with the right people, they will not only understand it, they will also appreciate it.
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me I look like I play 'disguise' or that I remind them of their seven-year-olds.
I smile and say, 'thank you'.
Thursday: Confidence is the key.
If you think you look good in something, then it is almost certainly so.
And if you think you don’t look good in something, you’re probably right.
I grew up with a mother who taught me this day by day.
But only when I was 30, did I really understand what that means.
And I will summarise that briefly for you.
If you believe that you are a wonderful person inside and outside, there is nothing you cannot wear.
So there is no excuse for anyone here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth – five words: Golden pearls fit to everything.
And last, Saturday: developing your own unique, personal style is a great way to tell the world about yourself without having to say a word.
I was proved time and again when people came to me this week simply because of what I was wearing, and I had great conversations.
Obviously, not all of this will fit into my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I will donate all of this.
The lesson I am trying to learn this week is that it's OK to let go.
I don't have to be emotionally attached to these things, because just around the corner there will always be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit waiting for me only if I have a little love in my heart and look for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good day, all together.
I have something here that I would like to show you.
Think of this as a point of view, as a flying point of view.
This is what we call in our laboratory, recognizable design.
Let me tell you a little about it.
If you take this picture – I am originally Italian, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture in his room – but the reason I am showing it to you is because something very interesting has happened in Formula One over the last decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you won the race.
Nowadays, if you want to win a race, you really need something like this here – something that monitors the car in real time, has several thousand sensors, transmits the information from the car, then passes it on to the system and then uses it to send back decisions to the car and change things in real time while information is collected.
This is what you would call a real-time control system, in engineering teams.
And, in essence, it is a system that consists of two parts – a sensitive part and a reacting part.
What is interesting today is the real-time control systems are beginning to appear in our lives.
Our cities have been equipped with networks and electronics in the last few years.
You will become a computer in the open.
And as computers outdoors, they start to react in a different way, they are perceived and driven.
When we build cities, that is a big deal indeed.
By the way, I would like to mention that cities only account for two per cent of the earth's surface, but that they account for 50% of the world's population.
They account for 75% of energy consumption – cause up to 80% of CO2 emissions.
So if we do something with the cities, it is a big deal.
Beyond the cities, all of these perceptions and impulses integrate into objects of daily life.
This is part of an exhibition organized by Paola Antonelli for MoMA later in the year, during the summer.
It is called 'talk to me'.
Well, all our objects, our environment, are beginning to speak back to us.
In a sense, it is almost as if every atom out there becomes two, a sensor and a driver.
And that radically changes the interaction we humans have with our environment outside.
In a sense, it is almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo...
You know that when Michelangelo sculpted Moses, it is said that at the end he took the hammer and threw it on Moses – indeed you can still see a small spot underneath – and said, cried, 'Perché non parli?
Well, today, our environment is beginning to respond to us for the very first time.
I will give you just a few examples – once again, with the idea of perception and driving our environment.
Let us start with perception.
Now the first project I would like to present to you is in fact one of the first of our laboratory.
It was created four and a half years ago in Italy.
What we did was actually to use a new type of network that was used around the world – a mobile phone network – and to use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, which is already collected by the operator to understand how the city works.
The summer was a happy summer – 2006.
It was when Italy won the World Cup.
Some of you will recall that it was when Italy played against France, and then in the end Zidane, the head kick.
And no matter, Italy won in the end.
Now you can see what happened on that day, just by watching the activity that happens in the network.
Here you can see the city.
You will see the Colosseo in the middle, the Tiber River.
In the morning, before the match.
You see the time axis at the top.
Early in the afternoon, people making calls and moving around.
The game begins – silence.
France scores a goal; Italy scores a goal.
Halfway through the day, people make a short call, go to the toilet.
Second half: end of normal game time.
First extension, second.
Zidane, in one moment the headshot.
Italy wins. Yeah.
Well, that night, everyone went to the center to celebrate.
They saw the big blow.
The next day, everyone went to the center to meet the winning team and the Prime Minister at the same time.
And then everyone went down.
You can see the picture of the square of Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate – to have a big party – and you can see the eruption at the end of the day.
Well, this is just one example of how we can feel the city today, in a way that we could not feel a few years ago.
Another example of feelings: this is not about people, but about things we use and consume.
Well, today we know everything about where our things come from.
This is a card that shows you all the chips that make up a Mac computer as they came together.
But we know little about where the matters are going.
So we actually designed some small markers in this project to track the garbage while it goes through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to mark the things they throw away – various kinds of things, as you can see – things they would throw away anyway.
Then we glued the small chips, the small marks, onto the trash and started to track it.
Here are the results we have just received.
From Seattle...
after one week.
With this information we discovered that there are a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can indeed do the same things with less energy.
The data was not available before.
But there are a lot of unnecessary transports and complicated things happening.
The other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away does not simply disappear, it is still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we throw away every day still remains there.
And if we showed people that, we could push for a change in behaviour.
That is therefore the reason for this project.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, could tell you much more about awareness and the many other wonderful things that can be done with awareness, but I would like to talk about the second part that we discussed at the beginning, and that is the exercise of our environment.
And the first project is something we did a few years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question from the mayor who came to us and said that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water as part of architecture in public places.
And the question was: how could technology, new technology, be combined with it?
And one of the ideas identified at MIT in a working group was, imagine these hoses, and valves, magnetic valves, flaps that open and close.
They create something like a water curtain with water dots.
When these dots fall down, you can write to them, you can show patterns, pictures, text.
And you can approach it and it will open to let you jump through, as you can see in this picture.
Well, we have presented it to Mayor Belloch.
It was very nice.
And we were asked to design a building at the entrance of the Expo.
We called it the Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building was made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open and let you in.
The roof was also covered with water.
And if it is windy, if you want to reduce the spray, you can even leave the roof down.
Or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be, as in this case, you know, these days, when you go down the roof, you get pictures of people who were there and say, "you destroyed the building."
No, they did not destroy the building, it is just that the architecture is almost disappearing.
Here you can see how the building works.
You see the person wondering what is happening inside.
And here you see me trying to avoid getting wet while testing the sensors that opened the water.
Well, I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
But it was actually a lot more fun that night.
All the children from Zaragoza came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different.
No longer a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water, you had to jump now without getting wet.
And that was very exciting for us, because as architects, engineers, as designers, we always think about how people use the things we design.
But reality is always unpredictable.
And that is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people.
Here is a picture of the building with the physical dots, the dots from water and the projections on it.
And that is what prompted us to think about the following project that I am showing you now.
Imagine these dots really starting to fly.
Imagine you have small helicopters flying through the air, and each of you with a small point of view with changing light – almost like a cloud moving through space.
Here is the video.
Imagine a helicopter like the one you saw earlier moving in complete synchrony with others.
You can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this – a uniform formation in two dimensions.
Or irregularly, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the point of view.
You can play with different types of cards.
Imagine the screen appearing in different formats or sizes, at different resolutions.
But then the whole thing could be just a 3D cloud of image points you can access and move through, which you can see from many, many directions.
Here you see a real flyfire control that sinks down to form a smooth V as before.
When you turn on the light, it looks like this, just like we saw it before.
Imagine that each one is controlled by people.
Every single point of the picture could have an impulse that comes from people, from people's movements, or the like.
I would like to show you something here first of all.
We worked with Roberto Bolle, one of the best ballet dancers of our time – the Étoile at the Metropolitan Theatre in New York and the Scala in Milan – we recorded his movements in 3D to use them as an impulse for the Flyfire.
Here you see Roberto dancing.
On the left you see the dots, the different impressions captured.
It is a real-time 3D scan and a motion picture.
So that you can follow the whole movement.
You can do that all the time.
But then, once we have all the points of the image, you can play with it and play with Color Motion gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible stimulus for the flyfire.
I would like to show you the latest project we are working on.
It is something we are working on for the Olympic Games in London.
It is called The Cloud.
The idea is, imagine, that we would again involve people to do something and change the environment – almost like what we call cloud movement, moving a barn gate, but with a cloud.
Imagine that anyone can make a small donation for a picture point.
I think that the remarkable thing of the events of recent years, of the last decades, is that we have moved from a physical world to a digital world.
That has digitized everything, knowledge, and makes it accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time – as Obama’s campaign has shown – we can move from the digital world, from the self-organizing forces of networks to the physical world.
This can be, in our case, that we use it to design and create a symbol.
This means something built in the city.
But tomorrow, in order to face up to the challenges ahead – think of climate change or CO2 emissions – how can we then move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is therefore that we actually involve people in doing things together, collectively.
The cloud is again a cloud of dots, in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And these particles are water, while our cloud is a cloud of dots.
It is a physical entity in London, but covered with dots.
You can move inside and make different kinds of experiences.
You can actually look at it from below, share the most important moments for Olympia 2012 and beyond, and use it as a way of connecting to the community.
So both, the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top of which you can go, like London's new mountain peak.
You can go in.
And a kind of digital lighthouse at night – but most importantly, a new kind of experience for all those who want to go to the top.
Thank you.
As an artist, the context is very important to me.
Through my work I try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
The first time I was in Antarctica nearly 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was taken in awe.
My heart was racing, I was dizzy while trying to grasp what was standing in front of me.
The icebergs around me stood almost 60 meters from the water, and I was amazed that it was a snowflake on another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or as they break out of ice floes.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others cannot stand it and collapse in a surge of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, you easily think that they are isolated, separated and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
As an iceberg melts, I breathe its premature atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich drinking water, which nourishes many species of life.
I take these icebergs as if I were making portraits of my ancestors, in the knowledge that they exist in this way in these individual moments and will never exist again.
It is not death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path along the life cycle.
Some of the ice in the icebergs I am photographing is very young – a few thousand years old.
And some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show an iceberg I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
Very rarely, you actually see a rolling iceberg.
Here you see it.
On the left you see a small boat.
It is about five metres long.
Please take care of the shape of the iceberg and where it is on the waterline.
You can see here that he is starting to roll and the boat has moved to the other side, the man is there.
This is the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It rises about 120 feet from the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
And simply so, the iceberg shows you another side of its personality.
Thank you.
My life is really blessed by working on some amazing projects.
But the coolest thing I've ever worked on was about this guy.
Its name is TEMPT.
TEMPT was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s.
One day, he came back from running and said, 'Daddy, my legs are crawling'.
And that was the outbreak of ALS.
Tempt is now completely paralysed.
He can only use his eyes.
I was standing in front of him.
I have a company that makes design and animations, so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and respect in the art world.
We have therefore decided to support Tony – TEMPT – and his cause.
I met his father and his brother and said, 'We will give you this money,
what are you going to do with it?"
And his brother said: "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to meet him again And I asked: "Look, isn't that – I saw Stephen Hawking – can not all paralyzed people communicate using these devices?"
And he replied: "No, only if you are a member of the upper social class and have remarkable insurance, you can really do it.
Ordinary people are not able to access these devices.'
And I replied: 'How do you communicate now?'
Have anyone seen the movie 'Butterfly and the Dolphin'?
This is how they communicate – this is how their fingers run along.
I was amazed: 'Very archaic, how can that be?'
So I came with the need to simply issue a cheque and instead I issued a cheque that I had no idea how to redeem.
I made a commitment to his brother and father on the spot, saying: "Well, my proposal is this: Tony will speak, we will get him a machine and we will find a way to get him to do his art again.
It is a farce that someone who still carries all of this cannot communicate it'.
I therefore spoke at a conference a few months later.
I met these people from GRL, Graffiti Research Lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then draw on it with a laser pointer that only registers the negative surface.
They are therefore moving around and making art installations like this.
You say that all the things displayed above follow a life cycle.
It starts with the sexes, then comes the slander, then the Bush slander and finally people actually do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their presentations.
So I went home and ate dinner with my wife and told her about everything and we thought, 'Well, second, if there is this technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things, then we should find a way that TEMPT can control a laser so that he can do graffiti again, that would be brilliant.'
That was the beginning of the journey.
And about two years later, about one year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of going and going, we have achieved some things.
Firstly, we have knocked the doors of the insurance companies and have actually got a device for TEMPT to communicate with – a Stephen Hawking machine.
That was incredible.
And he is really extremely funny – I call him Yoda, because you talk to him, or you get an email and you think, "I'm so unworthy, this guy is incredible."
We also flew seven programmers from all over the world – literally from all over the world – to our home.
My wife, my children and I moved into the garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
Many of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that and that we would come back and all the pictures on the walls would have given way to graffiti.
But for over two weeks we programmed, we went to the beach promenade in Venice, my children were involved, my dog was also involved and we created it here.
It is called EyeWriter and you can see the description.
This is a cheap sunglasses we bought at the Venice seafront, a little copper wire and a few things from the DIY and electronics shops.
We took a PS3 camera, disassembled it, put it on an LED light and now we have a device that is freely accessible – you can build it yourself, we provide the code for free, the software can be downloaded free of charge.
We have created a device that is completely free of restrictions.
No insurance can afford to be a saver.
Also no hospital.
Every paralyzed person can now actually communicate or draw with his or her eyes alone.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, it was incredible.
At the end of the two weeks we went back to TEMPT's room.
I love this picture because it is the room of someone else and that is his room.
Now there is all this fuss about the great revelation.
and after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, noodle parties and nights spent, Tony drew for the first time after seven years.
And that is an impressive picture, because this is its life-support system and it looks beyond its life-support system.
We have tilted his bed so he can see the outside.
We have put a projector against a wall of the parking lot in front of the hospital.
And he drew again for the first time, in the presence of his family and friends – and you can only imagine what a feeling it was in the parking lot.
It was fun to have to break into the parking lot, so we felt rightly part of the spraying scene.
In the end he sent us an email with the following content: "For the first time in seven years I have drawn something.
I feel I was pushed under water and finally someone has reached the bottom and pulled my head up so that I can breathe'.
Is that not overwhelming?
This is something like our cry of resistance.
This keeps us focused and allows us to develop further.
We still have much to improve on this device.
It is an amazing device, but it is a magic wand.
And someone who has such artistic potential deserves so much more.
We are therefore finding out how to do it better, faster and stronger.
Since then, we have received all kinds of recognition.
We won a few prizes.
Remember, it is free, no one of us earns it.
All of this comes from our own pockets.
So the awards were 'Oh, that's fantastic'.
Armstrong twittered about us and then, in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the 50 best inventions 2010, which was really great.
The coolest thing about it – and this ends the circle – is that there will be an exhibition this April at the Geffen MOCA in the downtown of Los Angeles called "Art of the Streets".
and there will be pretty much the hardest representatives of the street art scene – Banksy, Shepard Fairey, CAWs – all these guys will be there.
TEMPT will be part of the show, which is quite freaky.
So what I mean is that if you see something that is impossible, make it possible.
Everything in this room was impossible – this stage, this computer, this microphone, the EyeWriter – everything was impossible at some point.
Make it possible – all of you here.
I'm not a programmer and I've never had anything to do with eye tracking technology, but I simply took something and surrounded myself with amazing people so that we could get something up and running together.
And this is the question that every one of you should ask yourself, every single day that you notice something that needs to be done, if not now, when, and if not me, who?
Thank you.
So I write for children, and I'm probably America's most read children's book author.
And I always tell people that I don't want to come like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leather, but no one has ever chosen a farmer.
Today I would like to tell you about circles and revelations.
Well, enlightenment is usually something you find because you drop it somewhere.
You go around the block and take it as a revelation.
This is a circle painting.
One of my friends did it – Richard Bollingbroke.
It is the kind of complicated circle that I would like to tell you today.
My circle started in the 1960s at high school in Stow, Ohio, where I was the class bully.
I was the one who was beaten green and blue every week in the boys' toilet until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by having me use the toilet in the teacher's room.
It did so in secret.
she did it for three years,
and I had to leave the city.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and it struck me to San Francisco in California – I found a lover – and then in the 1980s I found it important to start working with AIDS organisations.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night, I received a call from this teacher, Mrs Posten, who said, 'I must see you.
I am sad that we never met each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio and please come with the man I know you have found in the meantime.
And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer and that I would like you to hurry'.
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We saw her, we laughed, we wept, and we knew she had to be in a hospice.
We found one for them, we brought them there and we looked after them, and we looked after their family because it was necessary.
it was something we knew to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult met me, she turned into a box of ash and was put in my hands.
What happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle – and the revelation of which I was speaking was revealed.
The revelation is that death is part of life.
She saved my life and my partner and I saved her.
And you know, this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs.
He needs truth and beauty, and I am so glad that this has been mentioned so often here today.
He needs equally – he needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it is up to us to give these things.
Thank you.
Imagine a large explosion as you climb up to 1,000 meters.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine that makes knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
That sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique place that day; I sat on 1D.
I was the only person who was able to talk to the cabin crew.
I saw them immediately and they said, 'No problem, we have probably caught a few birds'.
The pilot had turned the machine and we were not so far away.
The hotel was very clean and comfortable.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot aligned the machine to the Hudson River.
That is not usually the route.
It switches off the engines.
Imagine a noisy aircraft.
And then he said three words – the most emotional words I have ever heard.
He says'making a fuss to a crash'.
I did not have to talk to the on-board staff any more.
I could see it in their eyes, there was horror, life was over.
I would now like to tell you three things I learned about myself on that day.
I learned that in one moment everything is different.
We have this life plan, we have these things we want to do in life and I thought of all the people I wanted to give a hand to and did not do so, all the fences I wanted to sweep, all the experiences I wanted to make and never did.
Later, while I thought about this, I thought of a saying that 'I gather bad wine'.
Because when the wine is ready and the person is there, I open it.
I never want to postpone anything in life.
And this urgency, this goal, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned on that day – and that was when we missed the George Washington Bridge, almost by the hair’s breadth – was that I thought, man, there is one thing I really regret.
I had a good life.
In my own humanity and with my mistakes, I sought to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity I have also given room to my ego.
And I regretted the time I wasted on meaningless things, with people who mean something.
And I thought about the relationship with my wife, with friends, with people.
And then, when I thought about this, I decided to banish negative energy from my life.
It is not perfect, but it is much better.
I did not argue with my wife for two years.
It feels great.
I don’t try to be right any more; I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned – while the inner clock starts to count "15, 14, 13,..." down,
you see the water coming.
I said 'please fly into the air'.
I do not want this thing to break down into 20 parts, as we know from documentation.
As we crash, I had this feeling, human, to die is not frightening.
It is almost as if we are preparing for it for our entire lives.
But it was very sad.
I did not want to go; I love my life.
And this sadness really formed in one thought, namely that I want only one thing.
I just wish I could see my children grow up.
About a month after that I visited a performance of my daughter – first-year-old, not much artistic talent...
... not yet.
And I celebrate, I cry like a little child.
And in the world everything made sense to me.
I realized then, by linking the points together, that in life it is only a matter of being a great father.
More than anything, everything else, my only goal in life is to be a good father.
I had the miracle of not dying on that day.
I received another gift, namely to look into the future and come back and live differently.
My call to all who fly today is: Imagine the same thing happening on your flight – please not – but imagine it; and how would you change?
What would you do that you postpone because you think you are there forever?
How would you change your relationship and the negative energy within it?
And more than anything else, are you the best parents you can be?
Thank you.
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is quite simple.
We do not want Iran to build the bomb.
The most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.
The grey boxes you see here are real-time control systems.
If we now manage to compromise the systems that control the speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
These grey boxes do not run with Windows software; they are based on a completely different technology.
But if we manage to get an effective Windows virus to settle on a laptop used by a maintenance engineer to configure this grey box, we are in business.
And that is the planning behind Stuxnet.
So we start with a Windows-Dropper.
The utility data is transferred to the grey box, damages the centrifuge and the Iranian nuclear energy program is delayed – order executed.
That is a child's play, is it not?
I would like to tell you how we found that out.
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was entirely unknown what the purpose of this construct was.
The only thing we knew was very, very complicated as far as the Windows part, the dropper part, is concerned, it made use of countless Zero Day vulnerabilities.
And it seemed to have something to do with these grey boxes, these real-time control systems.
This aroused our attention and we started a laboratory project in which we infected our environment with Stuxnet and examined this construct.
And then something funny happened.
Stuxnet behaved like a laboratory rats who didn’t like our cheese – sniffed on it, but didn’t want to eat it.
I did not see any point in doing so.
And after we had experimented with different types of cheese, I realised that this was a targeted attack.
Completely targeted at a specific target.
The dropper actively wanders around the grey box when a special configuration is detected, even when the special program it is trying to infect is running on the target.
If not, Stuxnet does nothing at all.
So that really piqued my interest and we started working on it, almost around the clock, because I thought, well, we do not know what the goal is.
It could be, say, an American power station, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So we should find out soon what the goal is.
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code and found it to be structured into two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one.
And we also noticed that they were very professionally constructed by people who obviously had all the insider information at their disposal.
They knew all the bits and bytes they had to attack.
They probably even knew the machine operator's shoe size.
So you knew everything.
And if you have already realized that the dropper from Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you: the usage data is a science in itself.
It is much more demanding than anything we have ever seen.
Here you can see a screenshot of this attack code.
We are talking about – about 15,000 lines of code.
Looks pretty much like old fashioned assembler language.
And I will tell you how we were able to get out of this code.
So what we were looking for first were system function calls, because we know what they do.
And then we looked for timers and data structures and tried to connect them to the real world -- potential targets in the real world.
So we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or refute.
To build these theories, we must remember that this is definitely high-level sabotage, it must be a high-level target and very probably it is in Iran, because it is where most infections have been reported.
Well, there are not several thousand targets in this area.
It actually runs to the Buschehr nuclear power plant and the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz.
So I said to my assistant, 'Get me a list of all the centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.'
And I called them and taped their knowledge to compare their expertise with what we found in the code and the data.
And that worked very well.
So we were able to connect the small digital explosive head with the rotor control.
The rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge, this black object you see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to break the rotor and even make the centrifuge explode.
What we also found out was that the attack's objective was actually to let it happen slowly and eerily -- obviously in an attempt to make maintenance engineers despair so they would not be able to get behind quickly.
The big digital explosive head -- we got an insight by looking at data and data structures very closely.
So for example number 164 stands out very strongly from this code; you cannot overlook it.
I started to study scientific literature about how these centrifuges are built in natanz and found that they are structured in so-called cascades, and each cascade contains 164 centrifuges.
So it made sense, it fitted together.
And it has improved.
These centrifuges in Iran are divided into 15 so-called levels.
And do you guess what we found in the attack code?
Almost identical structure.
So again, it really fitted well together.
And this gave us great confidence in what we were examining here.
Well, do not misunderstand me, it was not simply a case of going on like that.
These results were achieved by several weeks of hard work.
And often we simply ran into a dead end and had to regroup.
In any case, we found that both digital warheads were actually heading for the same goal, but from different directions.
The small explosive head takes over a cascade, and overturns and slows down the rotors, and the large explosive head interacts with six cascades and manipulates valves.
So, on the whole, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is.
It is natanz and it is only natanz.
So we do not need to worry that other goals of Stuxnet might be met.
Here is something really cool that we discovered -- really took me out of my socks.
There below is the grey box, and above it you see the centrifuges.
Well, what this thing does is that it intercepts the incoming values of sensors -- for example, pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that still runs during the attack, with false incoming data.
And in fact, this false incoming data has already been recorded by Stuxnet.
So it is just like in Hollywood movies, where the surveillance camera is fed with previously recorded video during the hunt.
That's cool, isn't it?
The idea is obviously not just to outsmart the machine operators in the control room.
In fact, it is much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to outsmart a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human machine operator cannot react quickly enough.
In a power plant, for example, if the large steam turbine becomes too fast, discharge valves must be opened within milliseconds.
Of course, this cannot be done by a human machine operator.
So at this point we need digital security systems.
And if they are at risk, then really bad things can happen.
The power station may explode.
Neither the machine drivers nor the safety system will notice it.
This is frightening.
But things are getting worse.
And what I am saying now is very important.
Think about it, this attack is generic.
It has nothing specifically to do with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
So it would work just as well, for example, in a power plant or an automobile factory.
It is generic.
And you don't have to -- as the attacker -- attach the utility data via a USB stick, as we saw with Stuxnet.
You could also use common worm technology to spread.
It is necessary to spread it as widely as possible.
And if you do that, you will end up with a cyber-weapon of mass destruction.
That is the consequence we have to face.
So, unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
They are in the United States, Europe and Japan.
So all these green areas, these are the most attractive areas.
We must face up to the consequences and we must start preparing better.
Thank you.
I have a question.
Ralph, there has been a lot of reporting that people suspect that Mossad is the main organisation behind it.
Do you agree with that?
Well, you really want to know that?
Yes, okay.
I believe that Mossad is involved, but the driving force is not Israel.
So the driving force behind this is the cyber superpower.
There is only one and that is the United States -- fortunately, fortunately.
Otherwise, our problem would be even greater.
Thank you for giving us a fear of a devil.
I have spent the last few years getting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somehow dangerous.
I went to prison -- difficult.
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous.
I have filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this here -- fun at the beginning, a bit difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
I have actually spent most of my career exposing myself to apparently terrible situations, all just trying to examine social issues in a way that is captivating and interesting, and hopefully understandable in a way that makes them entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was going to come here to look at the world of branding and sponsorship in a TEDTalk, I knew I was going to do something a little different.
Some of you may have heard that I placed an ad on Ebay a few weeks ago.
I sent a few Facebook messages, a few Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to get the name rights to my TEDTalk 2011.
Indeed, some happy people and companies, for-profit and non-profit, got the unique opportunity -- because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never allow it again -- to buy the name rights to the talk you are watching, which at the time had neither a title nor much content and did not give many indications of what the topic would actually be.
So what you got was your name presented here: My TEDTalk, of which you don't know what the topic will be, and which could actually fly around your ears depending on the content, especially if I let your company get stupid for their participation.
But that being said, it is a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people watch these TEDTalks?
A great deal.
That is, by the way, only the working title.
So, despite this warning, I knew that somebody would buy the name rights.
If you had asked me about this a year ago, I would not have been able to tell you this with certainty.
But in the new project I am working on, my new film, we explore the world of marketing, advertising.
As I said, over the years I have gone into some quite terrible situations, but nothing has allowed me to prepare myself, nothing has allowed me to equip myself to go into a room with these types of people.
You know, I had the idea for a movie.
What I want to do is a movie about product placement, marketing and advertising, with the whole film financed by product placement, marketing and advertising.
And the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold".
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" is that everything, from top to bottom, from beginning to end, is entirely marked with marks -- from the title sponsor you will see in the movie, that is, mark X.
Well, this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center...
these people will be connected to the movie forever – forever.
And so the film will explore this whole idea -- That's what?
I am a redundant person.
That was more to be emphasised.
It was 'In eternity, forever'.
But we will not only have brand X as title sponsor, but we will make sure that we will sell any category in the movie.
So we might sell a shoe and it will become the most grand shoe you have ever worn...
the greatest car you've ever driven, from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" the greatest drink you've ever had, a attention from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold".
The idea is therefore, apart from showing that brands are part of life, actually to get them to finance the film?
And we are actually showing the whole process of how it works.
The aim of the whole film is transparency.
You will see the whole thing happen in the movie.
So that is the whole concept, the whole movie, from the beginning to the end.
I would be pleased if CEG would help to make this happen.
Know it is funny because when I heard it first, it is the ultimate respect for the audience.
But I do not know how sensitive people will be.
Do you have a perspective -- I do not want to use "perspective", because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how that will develop?
How much money will it take to make this happen?
1.5 million.
I think it will be difficult to hit them, but I think it is worth talking about some really well-known brands.
Who knows, when the movie comes out, we may look like a horde of full idiots.
What do you think the answer will be?
The answer will most likely be 'no'.
But is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing because of me?
JK: Both.
... Means, not so optimistic.
So, my lord, can you help me?
I can help.
Okay.
Fantastic.
We need to consider which brands.
Yes.
If you look at the people you are dealing with...
There are a number of places to which we can turn.
Turn off the camera.
I thought 'turn off the camera' would mean we wanted to have a background conversation.
It turned out that it actually meant 'We don't want to have anything to do with your film'.
And simply all these companies disappeared, one after another.
No one wanted to have anything to do with the movie.
I was amazed.
They didn't want to have anything to do with the project.
And I was confused because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising was to present your product to as many people as possible, to let as many people as possible see it.
Especially in today's world, at this interface between new and old media and the fragmented media landscape -- it is not the idea to be in this new exciting media tool that brings this message to the masses.
No, that was what I thought.
But see, the problem was that my idea had a fatal error, and that was the following.
No, it was not the fault at all.
That would not have been a problem at all.
That would have been fine.
But what this image represents is a problem.
See if you enter transparency in Google search is this -- This is one of the first images that appears.
I really like your style, Sergey Brin.
That was the problem: transparency -- free from deception and slander, easy to discover and see; immediately understandable; characterized by visibility and access to information, especially in terms of business practices -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem.
You know, we are hearing a great deal about transparency at the moment.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEOs say it.
But when it comes to implementing it, something changes.
But why? Well, transparency is fearsome -- like this strange bear that still roars.
It is unpredictable -- like this strange country road.
And it is also very risky.
What else is risky?
Eat a whole bowl of Cool Whip.
That is very risky.
So when I started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want you to tell our story'.
Look, when I was a child and my father caught me lying -- and he is sitting and looking at me with this eye -- he would say, "My son, there are three versions of every story.
There is your version, there is my version, and there is the real version.'
You see, we wanted to tell the true story with this film.
But since only one company, an agency was willing to help us -- and only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I found that I had to do it alone, I had to bypass the middle man and go directly with my team to the companies.
So what you suddenly began to understand -- or what I began to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies, the idea of how your brand is understood is a comprehensive problem.
I have friends who make big, huge Hollywood films, and I have friends who make small independent films like me.
And my friends who make big, huge Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films say, 'Well, how are we going to compete with these big, gigantic Hollywood films?'
And the film is called 'The Greatest Movie Ever Sold'.
So how exactly will we see Ban in the movie?
Whenever I go on my way, and whenever I open the medical cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant.
And every time I interview someone, I can say, "Are they fresh enough for this interview?
You are a little nervous.
I would like to help you to reassure yourself.
So perhaps you should apply a little of it before the interview'.
And then we offer one of these great scents.
Either "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds", you will have the choice.
We will be equipped for men and women -- fixed, roll-on, or stick, whatever.
That is the summary.
Now I can answer all your questions and give you a sensitive version.
We are a smaller brand.
Just as you talked about the smaller films, we are a challenger as a brand.
We do not have a budget like other brands.
So doing such things -- you know, reminds people of Ban -- that's somehow why we are interested.
What words would you use to describe Ban?
Ban is plain.
That is a great question.
Ms.: superior technology.
Technology is not the way to describe something that someone does under his shoulders.
We speak of bold, fresh.
I think "fresh" is a super word that makes this category really positive, unlike "fights odor and moisture."
It keeps you fresh.
How can we keep you fresher for longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher.
Such things have a more positive effect.
And that is a multi-million company.
What is wrong with me?
I have to talk to the man on the street who is like me, ordinary consumer.
You are supposed to tell me something about my brand.
How would you describe your brand?
Hmmm, my brand?
I do not know.
I really like beautiful clothing.
Ms.: 80s Revival meets skater punk, except on the washing day.
Well, what is the brand Gerry?
It is unique.
I think the genre, the style I have, is probably "dark glamour".
I like lots of black colours, lots of gray tones and that kind of stuff.
But normally I have an accessory like sunglasses, or jewelry and such stuff.
Ms.: If Dan were a brand, it would probably be a classic Mercedes convertible.
Man 2: The brand I am is, I would say, casual fly.
Ms 2: Partly hippie, partly yogi, partly Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.
Man 3: I am the costume type.
I sell dolls all over the country, worldwide.
I think that is my brand.
That is my brand in my small, distorted industry.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver goods.
Man 5: Branded alcoholic scribe.
Is that possible?
Attorney: I am a trademark of attorneys.
I am Tom.
Well, we can not all be the Tom brand, but I often see myself at the interface of dark glamour and casual fly.
And what was noted was that I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could penetrate my mind, someone who could really help me understand what is called a 'brand personality'.
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They have helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark to discover this brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could certainly help me.
You brought your pictures, yes?
The first picture is a picture of my family.
Just tell me a little about how it is connected with your thoughts and feelings about yourself.
These are the people who shape my worldview.
Tell me about this world.
MD: This world, I think, is the world in which you live -- like people around you, the friends, the family, the way you live your life, work and so on.
All these things come from and start from a place, and for me they come from and start with my family in West Virginia.
What is the next thing you want to talk about?
The next day was the most beautiful day of my life.
What is the connection with your thoughts and feelings about yourself?
It is as I would like to be.
I like things that are different.
I like things that are strange, I like strange things.
Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does it bring us?
What is the Machete?
Why is it important to reboot?
Tell me a little about this part.
A little more about you that are not you.
What other metamorphoses have you gone through?
... Do not worry, what kind of rollercoaster are you in?
No, thank you!
Thank you for your patience.
Yes,. Well, well.
Yes, I do not know what will result from this.
There were a lot of crazy things going on.
The first thing I saw was this idea that your brand personalekti has two separate but complementary sides -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is a careful/playful brand.
The two complement each other very well.
And I think there is almost a contradiction with that.
And I think some companies will focus on one strength rather than both.
Many companies -- and that is human nature -- tend to avoid things where you are not sure, they will be afraid to avoid these elements and that you welcome them, and you actually turn them for yourself into something positive, and that is a skillful move.
Which other brands do this?
The first is a classic, Apple.
And you can also see it here, Target, Wii, Mini from Mini Coopers and JetBlue.
Well, there are playful marks and gentle marks, these things that come and go, but a playful, gentle mark is a pretty strong thing.
A careful, playful brand.
If someone asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, how would it be?
You are an up-attractive, you are something that causes blood to swell.
Or are you a down-attribute?
Are you something that is a little quieter, more reserved, more conservative?
Up attributes are things that are playful, fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, extravagant and lovely like Erol Flynn, agile and agile, profane, harsh, magical and mystical like Gandalf.
Or are you more like a down attribute?
Are you as meticulous and noble as 007?
Are you established, traditional, caring, protecting, compassionate as Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, family, safe, safe, holy, thoughtful and wise as the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
During the film we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and said "no" because they didn't want to be part of the project.
Above all, you did not want to have anything to do with this film because you had no control, no control over the finished product.
But 17 brand partners were found who were willing to give up on this control, who wanted to do business with someone as careful and playful as I was, and who eventually enabled us to tell stories that we would never have been able to tell -- stories that advertisers would never support.
They enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing, just as we tell the story in this film that MRIs are now used to punch the lust centres of the brain, both for advertising and for filming.
We went to Sao Paulo, where outdoor advertising has been banned.
For five years, there has been no advertising board, no poster, no flyer, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are making their way to impoverished schools, across America.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I got the most feedback from or where I had the greatest success are those where I interacted directly with things.
And that is what these brands have done,
because they circumvented the middle man, they circumvented the agencies and said that the agencies may not really have their interests in mind.
I will negotiate directly with the artist.
I will work with him and create something completely different, something that will make people think, something that will challenge our worldview.
And how was it successful for them?
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, we can take a look at it.
According to Burrelles, the premiere was in January, and since then -- and that's not even the whole thing -- there have been 900 million calls of this movie.
This actually covers only a period of 2 1/2 weeks.
This is only online -- no press, no TV.
The film has not yet been delivered.
It is not even online, no streaming.
He has not yet come out of other countries.
Well, finally the film has gathered a very great deal of momentum.
And that is not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency we talked to recommended their clients to let go.
Something I firmly believe in is that if you seize the opportunity to take risks, there are opportunities in these risks.
I believe that if people are prevented from doing so, they are being brought closer to failure.
I believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks, you are preparing the whole company to make a profit.
I feel that as we move forward we need to encourage people to take risks.
We must encourage people not to be afraid of opportunities that may frighten them.
Finally, as we move forward, we should welcome fear.
We should put the bear in a cage.
Welcome fear, Welcome risk.
Each a big spoon full, we welcome the risk.
Finally, we should welcome transparency.
Nowadays, more than ever, a bit of honesty takes us very far.
And said this with honesty and transparency, my entire talk "Welcome to transparency" was presented to you by my good friends from EMC, who paid $7100 for the name rights on Ebay.
Large data is transformed into big opportunities for organisations around the world.
EMC presents "Welcome to Transparency"
Thank you very much.
Well, Morgan, in the name of transparency this: what exactly happened to the $7100?
That is a great question.
I have in my pocket a check issued to the TED executive, the Sapling Foundation -- a check of $7100 to finance my TED appearance next year.
My name is Amit.
18 months ago I was doing something else at Google and I suggested doing something with museums and art, and my boss, who is also today, gave me the green light.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I will focus on the show.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal view is explained very easily with this slide and its access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education – I do not complain – but I had too many museums and these works of art not accessible.
When I then traveled and visited these museums, I started to learn a lot.
And, as I worked for Google, I tried to combine this longing – to make art more accessible – with technology.
We then formed a team, a great team, and we started with this.
I will probably start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start.
So just go to GoogleArtProject.com.
You can look around in all these museums here.
There are the Uffizi, the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
I even come to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
You can enter the hotel by two ways – very simple.
Click, and wumms, you are in this museum.
It doesn’t matter where you are – Bombay, Mexico, it doesn’t matter.
You go around and have fun.
You want to orient yourself in the museum?
Open the map and jump with one click.
You are there, you want to go to the end of the gang.
Enjoy the game.
Please browse.
Thank you, but the best is yet to come.
So I am looking at one of my favourite pictures, Pieter Breugel's harvester in the Met.
I see this plus sign.
When the museum has given us the picture, click on it.
This is one of the pictures.
Here are all the metadata.
Those of you who are really interested in art can click here – but I will click away now.
This is one of the pictures we took with the so-called Gigapixel technology.
This image, for example, has about 10 billion image points, I believe.
And a lot of people ask me: "What do you get for 10 billion image points?"
I will show you that now:
You can zoom in and out very easily.
You see something funny here.
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.
But then you really want to go deep.
And so I started to play around and I realized something was happening there.
And I thought, 'Look, that sounds interesting'.
I went close and slowly noticed that these children were actually shooting.
I did some research, talked to some acquaintances at the Met and indeed found out that it was a game called squail, where a goose is beaten with a stick on Christmas Tuesday.
It seemed to be quite popular.
I do not know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
To get really close, you can go to the cracks.
Just to give you an overview, I zoom out to see what you get.
Here we were, and this is the painting.
But the best is yet to come – in a second.
Let us jump quickly to MoMA, back in New York.
Another favorite picture of mine, Starlight.
The previous example was about finding details,
but what if you want to see the brushstrokes?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh created this masterpiece?
The shuttle buses are very handy for getting to the airport.
I will zoom into one of my favorite parts of this picture until I am really at the cracks.
This is Starlight Night, probably never seen before.
Now I will show you my favourite function.
There are many more, but I do not have the time.
This is the cool part, it's called Collections.
Everyone of you, everyone – rich or poor, whether you have a great house – does not matter.
You can start creating your own museum online – from all these pictures you can create your own collection.
Simply, you go in – and I created this, it is called The Power of Zoom – you can zoom around.
This is 'The Envoys', in the National Gallery.
You can add notes to everything, send it to your friends, and so start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces.
I think, finally, the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here do not come from Google.
I do not think they even come from the museums.
I should not say that.
They come from the artists.
And that was an experience in humility for me.
I think I hope that we will do justice to art with this digital medium and represent it properly online.
The biggest question I am asked recently is: 'Have you done this to replicate the experience of a visit to a museum?'
The answer is no.
It is intended to supplement experience.
That is what it is about.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain, which can be divided into two halves.
This is the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive side.
If we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, we could represent its brain.
For example, this would be someone who is entirely logical.
This would be someone who is completely intuitive.
Well, where would you position your brain on this scale?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but I think that for most people in the audience, your brain looks like this -- with a high aptitude that is simultaneously in both hemispheres.
It is not as if they are both exclusive or the like.
They can be logical and intuitive.
And so I see myself as one of the people, along with most other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good amount of logic to assemble the complex ideas together.
But at the same time we need a good amount of intuition to actually carry out the experiments.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we love to play with things.
So we go out and play with it and then see how it reacts, and then we start to develop our intuition there.
In fact, you are doing the same thing.
So one of the intuitions they have developed over the years is probably that one thing can be at the same time only in one place.
I think it may sound strange to think that something is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this idea, you developed it.
I remember seeing a child playing on a threshold.
He was still a little child and not very good at it and he fell constantly.
But I bet that playing with the bottom line taught him a very valuable lesson, namely that big things don't just let you pass and that they stay in one place.
And that is a great conceptual model of the world, as long as you are not a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they are not playing with bottom thresholds, but with these little strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find all kinds of strange things -- like flying directly through walls, or being in two different places at the same time.
And thus they written all these observations, and called them the Theory of Quantitative Mechanics.
That was the state of physics a few years ago; one needed quantum mechanics to describe the small, tiny particles.
But you didn’t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us.
I didn't like that, perhaps because I don't play with particles so often.
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often.
And I have never seen them.
I do not think anyone has ever seen a particles.
But my logical side didn't like it either.
For if all things are particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics, shouldn’t everything follow the rules of quantum mechanics?
I see no reason why this should not be the case.
I would feel much better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago I started doing exactly that.
I created one.
This is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanic superposition.
So what we are looking at here is a tiny computer chip.
And you can see this green dot in the middle.
That is the piece of metal I will talk about in a moment.
This is an image of the object.
Here I enlarge it a little, we are looking at the centre.
Here is a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal.
So what we are looking at is a small piece of metal, shaped like a leapfrog and standing over the edge.
I did this thing in a similar way to making a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with new silicon disks, and racked for 100 hours on all the big devices.
For the last bit I had to build my own machine -- to get this hole shaped like a swimming pool and the thing.
This thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanic superposition but it needs a little help to do it.
Look, let me give you an analogy.
Do you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full lift?
I mean, when I am in the lift alone, I do all kinds of strange things, but then other people are coming in and I stop doing all these things because I do not want to bother them or, frankly, scare them.
Quantum mechanics therefore says that immobile objects feel the same way.
The passengers of immobile objects are not only humans, but also the light that shines on them and the wind that passes them and the heat of space.
And so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we had to throw out all the fellow passengers.
And that is what we did.
We switched off the light, put it in a vacuum and sucked all the air and cooled it until almost the now, alone in the lift, the piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted.
So we measured its movement.
We found that things are really moving strangely.
Instead of simply lying there, it vibrated, the way it vibrated was roughly like this one -- as a balloon that stretches and pulls together.
By giving it a little push, we could cause it to vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something only allowed in quantum mechanics.
So what I am telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not to vibrate?
Let us think about atoms.
So the first case: all the trillions of atoms that make up the piece of metal lie quietly there and at the same time the same atoms move up and down.
Only at precise times do they agree.
The rest of the time they are delocalized.
This means that every atom is at two different places at the same time, which at the same time means that the entire piece of metal is at two different places.
I think that is really cool.
Really.
This was worth including me in the clean room for all this year because, check it, the scale difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, this piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you?
I mean that is only what my logical side says.
So, imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that feel?
How would your consciousness deal with the fact that your body is delocalized in space?
There is another aspect of history.
When we warmed it up, switched on the light and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece of metal was always in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intuition that it looks as if all the objects in the lift are in reality only quantum objects gathered together in a small space.
You hear a lot of talk about quantum mechanics saying that everything is connected to everything.
Well, that is not quite right;
There is more behind that, it goes deeper.
It is the case that these connections, your connections with all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that is the deep-seated and rare thing in quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we should reconceptualize how we think about economic development.
Our goal should be that when families consider where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities, all competing for new inhabitants.
At the moment we are a long way from achieving that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who do not even have a single city to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth as much more than it costs to build them.
So we could very easily equip the world with dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of new cities.
That may sound absurd to you now, if you have never thought about new cities.
Simply exchange the construction of apartments for the construction of cities.
Imagine that half of the people who want to live in apartments already do so, but the other half do not yet.
They could try to extend the capacity of existing apartments.
But know what you would be going to do, in these apartments and their surroundings there are laws to avoid complaints and to divert attention from the development.
It is therefore very difficult to comply with all these enlargements.
But one could go to a completely new place, build a completely new block of houses, provided that the laws there would support such construction and not hinder it.
So I proposed that governments create new land which would provide enough space for a city and gave it a name: charter cities.
Later, I found out that, around the same time, Javier and Octavio were reflecting on the challenge of reform in Honduras.
They knew that each year around 75,000 Hondurans leave their country to emigrate to the United States and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in Honduras.
At this point, Javier said to Octavio, 'What happens if we take an unpopulated area of our country- what if we simply give it to an embassy- part of the American embassy; part of the Canadian embassy- and if people then want to go to work under the Canadian rules or those of the United States, they can work there and do everything they would normally have to go to Canada or America'.
In the summer of 2009, Honduras suffered a severe constitutional crisis.
At the next scheduled elections, Pepe Lobo won in a turnaround, whose program promised both innovation and conciliation.
He called on Octavio to become his chief of staff.
In the meantime I prepared for a talk at TEDGlobal.
By improving, trying out and looking at consumers, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to the essential elements.
The first point is the importance of laws, laws that stipulate that you cannot disturb existing tenants.
We pay great attention to new technologies, but progress requires technologies and laws, and laws are usually the ones that keep us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio the link to the TEDTalk.
The in turn showed him Javier.
The two called me.
And they said, 'Let us present it to the President of our country!'
So we met in December in the meeting room of a hotel in Miami.
I have tried to make it clear how valuable cities are, how much more valuable than they cost.
And I used this graph to show how valuable a piece of land is in a place like New York.
But it was a rather abstract discussion, at one point when there was a break, Octavio said, 'Paul, could we perhaps look at the TEDTalk'.
The TEDTalk therefore explained in very simple terms that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited land, a founding treaty that lays down the laws that apply there and offers people the opportunity to choose between living under these rules or not.
That is why I was asked by the President of Honduras, who said that we must realise this project, that it is important and that this is the way to move our country forward.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and to give a lecture again on the fourth and fifth of January.
So I gave another facts-filled talk, which included a graph like this, which tries to make it clear that if you want to add a lot of value to a city, it must be a very large city.
This is a picture of the city of Denver, and the sketch shows the new airport built in Denver.
This airport alone has an area of 100 square kilometres.
So I have tried to convince Hondurans that if you want to build a new city, you have to start with an area of at least 1000 square kilometres.
That is more than 250 thousand mornings.
Everyone politely applauded.
The faces of the spectators were very serious and attentive.
The congress director came on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your talk, but could we perhaps look at the TEDTalk.
I have it here on my laptop'.
So I sat down and they played the TEDTalk.
And I came to the key point that a new city offers new opportunities to people.
There would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of kilometres away in the north.
And a new city also includes new opportunities for executives.
The leaders of the government in Honduras would need help from partner countries, they could benefit from their partner countries, who would help them to draw up the laws for this Charter and to ensure that everyone can rely on the Charter being enforced.
And President Lobo's insight was that the certainty of enforcement that I thought about as a way to get foreign investors to come and build this city could mean for all the parties in Honduras, which have been suffering from fear and distrust for many years.
We went to a region.
This picture is from this place.
It covers a thousand square kilometres without any difficulty.
Shortly afterwards, on 19 January, they voted in Congress to amend the Constitution to have a constitutional rule which is permissible for special development areas.
In a country that has just experienced a severe crisis, the Congress voted in favour of this constitutional change by 124 votes to one.
All the parties, all the groups in society, supported this.
In order to become part of the constitution, however, it must be approved twice by Congress.
On 17 February, it was approved for the second time by 114 votes to one.
Immediately after that election, between 21 and 24 February, a delegation of about 30 hundred hundred people travelled to the two places in the world most interested in getting involved in the urban business.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a large new city center built in South Korea - bigger than Boston's city center.
Everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to obtain the permits.
The other place that was very interested in urban development was Singapore.
Two cities have already been built in China and the third is in preparation.
So, if you think about it in practical terms, it is where we are today.
They already have a building site; and they are already considering this area for the second city.
Work is already being done on a legal system that allows managers to participate, and on an external legal system.
A country has already offered to make its Supreme Court available as a court for the final appeal of its judicial system.
Also urban designers and builders are very interested.
They even include funding.
One thing, as you know, has already been resolved, there are many tenants.
There are many businesses that would like to settle in America, especially in a place with a free trade area, and there are many people who would like to live there.
There are 700 million people around the world who declare that they want to live permanently in another place.
One million people leave Latin America every year and migrate to the United States.
Many of them are fathers who are forced to abandon their families in order to find work- sometimes single mothers who have to earn enough money to afford food and clothing.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children try to find their parents whom they have not seen for a decade.
So what kind of idea is it to consider building a completely new city in Honduras?
Or even to build dozens of these cities, or hundreds spread around the world?
So what kind of idea is it to insist that every family should have a choice between several cities competing for new inhabitants?
This is an idea worth spreading.
My friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you TED.
Do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day?
Do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week?
I recently conducted a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of decisions a typical American makes in one day is 70.
A recent study with CEOs was also conducted, where they observed CEOS for a week.
And these scientists have simply documented the different topics that these CEOs have been working on and how much time they have spent making decisions related to these topics.
And they found that an average CEO deals with 139 tasks a week.
Each of these issues, of course, consisted of many, many smaller decisions.
50% of their decisions were taken within nine minutes or less.
Only about 12% of their decisions took one hour or more of their time.
Think about your own decisions.
Do you know how many decisions you make in the nine-minute category compared to those in the one-hour category?
How good do you think you are to manage the decisions?
Today, I would like to talk about one of the greatest decision-making problems of our modern age, the problem of decision-making overload.
I would like to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
Well, when I talk about this problem, I will ask you some questions and I would like to know your answers.
If I ask you a question, because I am blind, just lift your hand if you want to burn a few calories.
Otherwise, I ask you if I ask you a question and the answer is yes, so my first question for today is: are you prepared to hear something about the problem of overloading decisions?
Thank you.
When I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I went to this very very exclusive grocery store; at least at that time it was really exclusive.
It was a shop called Draeger's.
This shop, it was almost like a funfair.
They had 250 different types of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables, and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drunk tap water.
I loved to go to this shop, but at one point I wondered, well, how is it that you never buy something?
Here is the olive oil barrel.
They had over 75 different types of olive oil, including those enclosed in boxes from thousand-year-old olive trees.
So one day I decided to visit the head of the branch and I asked the head, "Does this model that you really offer people all these opportunities really work?"
And he pointed at the busloads of tourists who came every day and usually had their cameras with them.
We decided to do an experiment and we chose jam for our experiment.
Here is their marmelade gang.
They had 348 different types of jam.
We have a small tasting corner located directly at the entrance of the shop.
We displayed six different tastes of jam or 24 different tastes of jam there, and we looked at two things: firstly, I which case would more people stand and try jam?
More people were left standing when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent.
And then we looked at which case people would rather buy a glass of jam.
Now we saw the opposite effect.
Of the people who stayed when it was 24, only three percent actually bought a glass of jam.
Of the people who remained standing when there were six, well, now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of jam.
Well, if you calculate it, people bought a glass of jam six times more often than if you had 24 to choose.
Well, deciding not to buy a glass of jam is probably good for us -- at least it is good for our waist -- but it turns out that the decision-overload problem also affects us in very significant decisions.
We do not decide to make a choice, even if it goes against our own best interests.
So to the topic of the day: financial saving.
I will now describe a study I carried out with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang, in which we looked at the decisions on pension saving plans for almost one million Americans from around 650 plans throughout the United States.
And what we looked at was whether the number of funds available to a pension saving plan, the 401 plan, would influence the likelihood of saving more for tomorrow.
And we found that there was indeed a connection.
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans offering people something between two to 59 different funds.
And what we found out was that the more funds were offered, that, in fact, the participation rate was lower.
If you look at the extremes, the plans that offered two funds had a participation rate in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want.
In the plans that offered almost 60 funds, the participation rate now fell to around the sixtieth percent.
Now it turns out that even if you decide to participate, if there were more options to choose from, even then, it has negative consequences.
Thus, the more options they had, the more they avoided buying stocks and funds.
The more opportunities they had, the sooner they put all their money into pure money market accounts.
None of these extreme choices is one of the choices that someone would recommend to people if their future financial well-being is important to us.
Well, over the last ten years, we have seen three major negative consequences in people of the increasing choice of choice.
They postpone the decision -- postpone it, even if it goes against their best interests.
They are making worse choices -- worse financial choices and worse medical choices.
They tend to choose things that they themselves are less satisfied with, even if they do it better in objective terms.
The main reason for this is that we may enjoy looking at these huge shelves of mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar and jam, but we cannot actually make comparisons and narrow down and then actually choose something from the fantastic range.
So what I would like to suggest to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways and at different research sites -- that you can easily apply in your business.
Firstly, limitation.
You have heard it before, but it has never been truer than today that less is more.
People are always worried when I say'restrain'.
You are always worried about losing rack space.
But in reality, we are seeing more and more that if you are willing to limit yourself and the unimportant similar opportunities are gone, well, then there will be an increase in sales, costs will be reduced, and decision-making will improve.
When Proctor and Gamble reduced the different Head and Shoulders types from 26 to 15, they experienced a 10 percent increase in sales.
When Golden Cat Corporation took over its 10 worst sold cat litter, profits rose by 87 percent -- a result of both, increasing sales and reducing costs.
You know, the average supermarket today offers you 45,000 products.
A typical Walmart offers 100,000 products today.
But the ninth largest supermarket, the ninth largest supermarket in the world today, is Aldi, and they offer only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in cans.
Now in the world of saving, I think one of the best examples that has come to the market recently of how best to manage choices was something that David Laibson played a very strong part in shaping, it is a programme offered at Harvard.
Every Harvard employee now automatically participates in a lifetime fund.
Those who really want to make a choice are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
Do you know how people often say, "I do not know how to limit it.
They are all important opportunities.'
And the first thing I ask the employees is, " tell me how the options differ from each other.
And if your employees cannot keep them apart, your customers cannot'.
Well, before we started this lunchtime, I had a conversation with Gary.
And Gary said he would be ready to offer all the people in this audience an all-inclusive paid holiday on the most beautiful street in the world.
Here is a description of the street.
And I would like to read it out to you.
And now I give you a few seconds to read them and then I ask you to knock if you are ready to accept Gary's offer.
Anyone who is willing to accept Gary's offer.
Are they all?
Well, let me show you a little more of it.
You knew there was a trick, did you?
Well, who is ready for this journey.
I think I have heard more hands.
Good.
The fact is that, objectively speaking, you had more information on the first occasion than on the second, but I would dare to guess that you felt it more real on the second occasion.
Because the pictures make it more real for you.
What brings me to the second technique that will help you deal with the problem of over-decision is concreteness.
The point is that, in order to understand the difference between possibilities, people must understand the consequences associated with each of these possibilities, and that these consequences must be felt vividly and concretely.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when using an EC card or credit card than when using cash?
Because it does not feel like real money.
And it turns out that if you manage to make something feel concrete, it is a very good tool to get people to save more.
So in a study I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with the people at ING -- employees who all worked for ING -- and these people were all in a meeting where they registered their participation in their pension savings plan.
And during this assembly, we have kept this assembly as it always was, only we have added a small detail.
The little thing we added was that we asked people to simply think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they saved money.
In doing this simple thing, there was a 20% increase in participation and there was an increase in the number of people who were prepared to save, or a four percent increase in the amount they were prepared to pay for the savings account.
The third technique: categorization.
We can deal with more categories than with more choices.
Here is, for example, a study we have done in a journal.
It turns out that there are in Wegmans supermarkets up and down in the northeast area, the number varies between 331 different types of magazines to high to 664 magazines.
But do you know what?
If I show you 600 magazines and divide them into 10 categories, or if I show you 400 magazines and divide them into 20 categories, you will believe that I have given you more choice and a better choice experience than I would have given you 400 compared to giving you 600.
Because the categories tell me how to keep them apart.
Here are two different decorations.
One is called "jazz" and the other is called "swing".
If you think the left display is swing and the right display is jazz, then you can simply pinch your hands.
Okay, there are a few.
If you think that the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, please click.
Okay, a few more.
Well, it turns out that you are right.
The one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, but do you know what?
This is a highly useless categorisation scheme.
The categories must tell the selector, not the selector.
And this is often the problem you see when you look at the long lists of all these funds.
Who do you want to inform by this?
My fourth technique: a prerequisite for complexity.
It turns out that we can deal with more information than we think, we just have to simplify it.
We must gradually increase the complexity.
I will give you an example of what I mean.
Let us take a very, very complicated decision: to buy a car.
Here is a German car manufacturer offering you the possibility to completely configure your car.
You have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car.
Now these decisions differ in the number of options they offer per decision.
Color of car, exterior color of car -- I have 56 options.
Engines, gearboxes -- four options.
What I am doing now is changing the order in which the decisions appear.
Half of the customers is going from the many possibilities, 56 car colors to the small possibilities, four gears.
The other half of the customers goes from the small possibilities, four gears, to the 56 car colours, many possibilities.
What do I look at?
How interested you are.
If you continue to use the default selection when making a decision, it means that you are overburdened, that is, I lose you.
What you find is that people going from the many to the small selection possibilities always choose the standard selection.
We are losing them.
If you move from the few options to the many, you will stay there.
The information is the same, the number of options is the same.
All I have done is to change the order in which this information is presented.
When I start with the simple one, I learn how to select.
Even though choosing the gearbox does not tell me about my preferences for interior design, it still prepares me to choose.
It also makes me excited about the great product I am making, and so I am ready to be motivated with interest.
Let me summarise.
I have told you about four techniques that will alleviate the problem of over-burden of decision-making -- limit -- remove the superfluous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can better deal with more categories, fewer options; prepare for complexity.
Each of the techniques I describe to you today is intended to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you, you can use them for yourself, good for the people you are offering service.
I believe that the key to the best possible choice is to be very careful in choosing.
And the more we are chosen, the better we will be able to exercise the art of choice.
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Kevin Allocca, Trends Manager at YouTube, and I watch YouTube videos professionally.
That is true.
Today we are going to talk about how videos become viral, and then why that is important at all.
We all want to be stars - celebrities, singers, comedians - when I was young, it seemed so interminably difficult.
But web videos have allowed us all, or all of our creative activities, to be famous beyond belief in a part of the world's culture.
Every single one of you could be famous on the internet until next Saturday.
But YouTube uploads more than 48 hours of video per minute.
Only a tiny percentage of this will ever become viral and will be viewed thousands of times, making it a cultural moment.
So how does this work?
Three things: Tastemakers, participation communities and the unexpected.
Well, then we want to.
Oh my God.
Oh my God!
Woah!
Ohhh, wowwww!
Last year, Bear Vasquez broadcast this video, which he had filmed in front of his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
This graph shows how it looked when the video first became popular last summer.
Bear didn't want to make a viral video.
He just wanted to share a rainbow,
because you do it when you are called Yosemite Mountain Bear.
He had uploaded a lot of natural videos.
And that video was indeed broadcast in January.
What has happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel came.
Jimmy Kimmel sent the tweet that eventually made the video so popular.
Tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel present new and interesting things to us and show them to a large audience.
They are going to be a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes longer than they were a few minutes
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It was viewed almost 200 million times this year.
That was the graphic.
Just like Double Rainbow, it seems to have come from nowhere.
What happened on that day?
Well, it was Friday, that is true.
If you want to know, these other tips are also Fridays.
But what about this day, this particular Friday?
Well, Tosh.0 went off, many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson of the Mystery Science Theater was one of the first to make a joke about this on Twitter.
It is important that an individual or group of Tastemakers took a standpoint, shared it with a large audience and thus accelerated the process.
Then this community of people who shared this great insider joke formed and started to talk about it and play around with it.
Now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
In the first seven days there was already a parody for every single day of the week.
Unlike the unilateral entertainment of the 20th century, Community participation is our way to become part of this phenomenon - either by disseminating it or by making something new of it.
"NYAN CAT" is animation and music in a seamless loop.
That is it, quite simply.
This year it was viewed almost 50 million times.
And if you think that is crazy, you should know that there is a three-hour version of it that has been viewed four million times.
Even cats are watching this video.
Cats look at cats watching this video.
What is important is the creativity that prevails in the internet culture of techies and geeks.
There were remixes.
Someone made an old-fashioned version of it.
And then it became international.
A whole remix community burst out of the ground, making it from a stupid joke into something we can all participate in.
Today we do not simply enjoy something, we are involved.
Who could have foreseen all of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat"?
What screenplays could you have written that contained this?
In a world where every minute 2 days of video material is uploaded, only truly unique and unexpected can stand out, such as the videos mentioned above.
I admit that I was not very interested when a friend told me to watch this great video about a guy protesting in New York against bicycle stickers.
I got a fine for not riding the bike, but often there are obstacles that do not allow you to ride the bike properly.
Because it was quite surprising and humorous, Casey Niestats funny idea and argument was viewed 5 million times.
This approach applies to all new things we do creatively.
And all of this leads us to the big question...
What does that mean?
Ohhh.
What does that mean?
Tastemakers, creative community of participants, completely unexpected, are the characteristics of a new type of media and culture to which everyone has access and in which the audience determines popularity.
As I said, one of the biggest stars of the moment – Justin Bieber – made his start on YouTube.
Nobody has to give the green light to your ideas.
And today we all feel as owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, and they hardly apply to today's media, but they will determine the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
How can I speak in ten minutes about the attachment between women over three generations, and how the astonishing strength of this attachment was manifested in the life of a four-year-old girl when she sat together with her little sister, mother and grandmother in a small boat in the Chinese Sea over 30 years ago, a attachment that remained embedded in the life of this little girl and never disappeared – this little girl who now lives in San Francisco and is speaking to you today?
The story is not yet over.
It is a puzzle that is still being assembled.
I would like to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces.
Imagine the first play: a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a writer, a man whose life has been kept together by the simple hope of the unity and freedom of his homeland.
When the Communists invaded Saigon, look at him as he admits that his life was a mere waste.
The words, as long as his friends, now mocked his.
He took a quiet rest.
He died, broken by history.
He is my grandfather.
I never met him personally.
But our lives are so much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
I had to make sure that it was not in vain, and it was my job to learn that history tried to crush us, but we survived.
The next puzzle piece shows a boat leaves the lake at dawn.
My mother Mai was 18 when her father died – already in an arranged marriage, already with two little girls.
For her life, life had given her a task: the flight of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was entirely excluded that it would fail.
After a four-year old and film-ready Saga, a boat glimpsed the lake, disguised as a fishing boat.
All adults were aware of the risks.
Their greatest fear was pirates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small poison bottle.
If I were taken captive, my sister and I would have drunk first, then she would have drunk it and my grandmother would have drunk it.
My first memories of this boat are the constant tuckering of the engine, the clawing of each wave on the bow, the wide and empty horizon.
I do not remember the pirates who came many times but were fooled by the deaths of the men on our boat, or the engine failure which did not want to start for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform off the Malaysian coast, and the young man who collapsed and died, the end of the trip was too much for him, and the taste of the first apple given to me by one of the men on the platform.
No apple has ever tasted like this again.
After three months in a refugee camp we landed in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together.
We moved to Footscray, a working class suburb with immigrant populations.
Unlike the old middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was completely unaware of, there was no ambition in Footscray.
The smells from the shop doors came from the rest of the world.
And the bits of broken English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common: they began again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a assembly line in a car factory, six days, double layers.
She managed to find the time to acquire English and IT qualifications.
We were poor.
Every dollar was allocated and spent on further education for English and Mathematics, no matter what we had to do for it, mostly new things, always second hand.
Two pair of socks for school, each to cover the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the ankles, because it had to last six years.
And there were the rare but painful choirs of "Schlitzauge" and here and there wall paintings: "Asian, go home."
Where to go home?
Something stuck in me.
There was a meeting for reconciliation and a quiet voice said: 'I will go out of your way'.
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we told each other about our day, and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares from the boat.
And it was my task to remain awake every night until their nightmares came, that I might awaken them.
She opened a computer shop, then went on to become a beautician and opened another shop.
And the women came with their stories of men who could not withstand change, angry and inflexible, and worried children caught between two worlds.
Loans and sponsors were sought.
Centres have been built.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student who made relentless demands of himself.
In the other, I was involved in insecure lives, which bore tragic scars of violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But so many people have received help over the years.
And because of this help, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year in my last year of law studies.
And I was catapulted from one piece of puzzle to another, and the edges didn't fit together.
Tan Le, an anonymous resident of Footscray, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to lectures in places she never heard of and in homes she never imagined existed.
I was not familiar with the label.
I did not know how to use the cutlery.
I did not know how to talk about wine.
I did not know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to return to the routine and comfort of the life of an unknown suburb – a grandmother, a mother and two daughters who ended each of their days as they had done for twenty years, telling each other the stories of their day and sleeping, we three still in the same bed.
I told my mother I would not manage to do that.
She reminded me that I was as old as she was when we climbed the boat.
No was never an option.
"Just do it," she said, "and do not be what you are not."
So I spoke about youth unemployment and education, and the neglect of the marginalised and disenfranchised.
And the more openly I spoke, the more I should tell.
I met people in all situations of life, so many of them did what they loved, lived at the limits of what was possible.
And although I had finished my studies, I realized that I could not settle for a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And at the same time I realized that it is okay to be an outsider, a newcomer, new in the picture – and not just okay, but something for which one must be grateful, perhaps a gift from the boat.
Being part of it can so easily lead to the collapse of the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the assumptions of the environment.
I have now gone out of my comfort zone enough to know that, yes, the world is breaking apart, but not as one fears.
Opportunities that would not have been allowed were expressly encouraged.
There was an energy, a relentless optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring.
So I followed my gut feeling.
I gathered a small team of people around me, for whom the "Don't Do" shelves were an irresistible challenge.
For a year we did not receive a cent.
At the end of each day I cooked a huge pot of soup that we shared.
We worked until late into the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but there were a few brilliant ideas and we made a breakthrough.
I made the decision to move to the USA,
after only one trip there.
My gut feeling again.
Three months later I moved and the adventure continued.
Before I finish the talk, I would like to tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after her birth.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother she beat.
Without her husband’s support, she caused a sensation by bringing him to court and being a prosecutor in her own case, and an even greater sensation when she won.
"It doesn't happen" proved to be untrue.
I was sleeping in a hotel room in Sydney when she died, 1000 km away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower partition and saw it on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother called me a few minutes later.
A few days later we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her coffin.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight, the monk came and said he had to close the coffin.
My mother asked us to touch her hand.
She asked the monk, 'Why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold?'
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
'They did not let them go'.
If there is a band in our family, it runs through the women.
When you see who we were and how life shaped us, you can see that the men who might have come into our lives would have taken us in the lurch.
Defeat would have been too easy.
Now I want my own children and I am thinking of the boat.
Who would ever want one?
Yes, I am afraid of privileges, of ease, of entitlement.
Can I give them a bug in their lives that courageously defies any wave, the untiring, constant tuckering of the engine, the wide horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I do not know.
But if I could give it and get it through safely, I would do it.
Tan’s mother is also in the fourth or fifth row here today.
I am here to share my photography with you.
Is it photography at all?
Because of course, this is an image that you cannot take with your camera.
Nevertheless, my interest in photography began when I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.
I combined it with my earlier preference for drawing, but it was a bit different, because when using the camera the process was rather in planning.
And when you take a picture with a camera, the process ends when you press the shutter release.
For me, photography seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time.
I thought everyone could.
So I wanted to create something else, something where the process begins when the shutter is pressed.
Photos like this: A construction site along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And still keeps a realistic level.
Or photos like this – dark and colorful at the same time, but all with the common goal of maintaining a realistic level.
When I say reality, I mean photo reality.
Because, of course, it is not something you can really capture, but I would like to make it look like it could have done that, on a photo.
Photos where you have to think for a moment to find the trick.
So it is more a matter of capturing an idea than a really moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it about details or colours?
Is it about light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But the ultimate issue is how we interpret the world and how it can be made tangible on a two-dimensional surface.
It is not a question of what is realistic, but what we think is realistic.
I therefore believe that the basics are very simple.
I see it as a reality puzzle, where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality.
And let me give you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly conceivable physical objects with which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional as if it could exist.
At the same time, however, we know that this is not possible.
We are therefore overtaking our brains, because our brain simply does not accept that it does not make sense.
And I see the same process in combining photos.
It is really only a matter of combining different realities.
So the things that make a picture look realistic, I believe the things we do not think about, the things around us in our everyday life.
However, when we combine photos, it is really important to remember that, otherwise they simply look somehow wrong.
I would therefore say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these are not three special pictures.
Combined, you can create something special like this.
The first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective.
Second, combined photos should have the same type of lighting.
And these two pictures fulfil these two requirements – from the same height and the same type of lighting.
Thirdly, it is a question of making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images begin and end by seamlessly connecting them.
Makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually composed.
By adding color, contrast and brightness to the edges of the individual images, by adding photographic flaws such as field depth, saturated colors and disturbances, we are confusing the borders between the different images and making them look like a single photo, although an image can actually contain hundreds of layers.
Here is another example.
One may think that this is just a landscape picture and the lower part has been manipulated.
This picture is in fact a complete set of photos from different places.
I personally think it is easier to create a place than to find a place, because you don't have to compromise with the ideas in your mind.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And when I had this idea in winter, I knew that I would need several months to plan it, to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was taken on a fishing trip.
The shore comes from another place.
The underwater part is from a quarry.
And yes, I even changed the house up on the island to red to make it look Swedish.
In my view, therefore, in order to achieve a realistic result, it amounts to planning.
I always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then we will have to combine the different images.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you take good pictures, the result can be quite nice, and also quite realistic.
So all tools are there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail.
And I think the most important thing about this is that we have stopped talking to our patients.
And one of the things we introduced at Radboud University was to have a main listener.
She does not do it scientifically – she offers a cup of coffee or tea and asks patients, families, relatives, "How is it?
How can we help you?"
And we think, we want to think, that this is one of the main problems why all – perhaps only most – of the electronic health projects fail: because we have stopped listening.
This is my WLAN scale, a very simple thing.
It has a button, On/Off.
And every morning I jump on it.
And yes, I have a job, as you may recognize.
I set my task at 95 kg.
It works very simple: every time I jump on the scale, it also sends my data to Google Health.
And there they are also called by my general practitioner to see where my weight problem lies, not only at the moment I need cardiology or something like that, but also with a look into the past.
There is something else, however.
You may know that I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I jump on my WLAN scale and people already talk to me before I sit in the car: 'For lunch, Lucien, just a small salad today'.
But that is the nicest thing that can happen, because it is group compulsion, group compulsion to help patients, because that could be used to combat obesity or it could discourage patients from smoking.
It could also be used to get people out of their seats and to get them to play some kind of game together in order to better control their health.
This will be available on the market from next week.
There will be this small blood pressure meter that you can connect to an iPhone or something like that.
And it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home, send it to their doctors, and share it, for example, with others, for just over $100.
This is where the patients come in: not only can they take control again, be captains on their own ship, but they can also help us in the health care sector in the face of the challenges that lie ahead, the explosion of health costs, double demand, and so on.
Make methods that are easy to use and start embracing patients in the team.
And that is what you can achieve through such methods, but also through crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we have done, I would like to share with you through a short video.
We have all navigation systems in our cars.
Perhaps even in our mobile phones.
We know very well where all the ATMs are around Maastricht.
We still know one thing: where are all the petrol stations?
And of course we can find fast food chains.
But where would the next AED to help this patient?
We asked around and no one knew.
No one knew where the next life-saving AED was at that moment.
So what did we do? We did a lot of crow-sourcing in the Netherlands.
We have built an Internet site and asked a crowd, 'If you see an AED, please tell us where it is, when it goes off', because sometimes it is closed during business hours, of course.
More than 10,000 AEDs have already been reported in the Netherlands.
The next step was to find the apps for it.
And we have designed an iPad app.
We have developed an app for Layar, extended reality to find these AEDs.
And if you are in a city like Maastricht and someone collapses, you can use your iPhone and, within the next few weeks, your Microsoft mobile to find the next AED that can save lives.
And from today we want to introduce this not only as AED4U as the product is called, but also as AED4US.
We want to bring this to a global level.
And we are asking our colleagues around the world, from other universities, to help us act as hubs to crowdsource these AEDs around the world.
And if you are on holiday and someone breaks up, be it your own family or someone else, you can find an AED.
The other thing we would like to ask for is that companies around the world help us to certify these AEDs.
These could be courier services, or technicians, for example, just to ensure that the AED reported is still in its place.
Please help us and try to not only improve health, but take it into your hands.
Thank you.
Today I will report unexpected discoveries.
I am working in the solar technology sector.
And my small startup wants us to force ourselves to protect the environment by...
... takes a closer look at crowdsourcing.
Here is a short video about what we do.
Oh, a moment.
It may take until it is loaded.
Well – we can just skip it – I will skip the video instead...
No.
That is not...
Okay.
Solar technology is...
Oh, my time is already over?
Okay, thank you.
So a few years ago I launched a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they hate, we let them work in government.
The program is called "Code for America" and it is a bit like the peace corps for computer freaks.
We select a few fellows each year and let them work with local authorities.
Instead of sending them to the developing world, we are sending them to the Councils.
And there they developed great apps, worked with urban employees.
But what they are really doing is showing what technology can do today.
So meet Al.
Al is a Hydrant in Boston.
Here it looks like he is looking for a date, but what he really is looking for is someone to throw him out when he is snowed in because he knows he is not very good at fire fighting when he is covered by a metre of snow.
How did he decide to seek help in this particular way?
Last year we had a team of fellows in Boston as part of the Code for America program.
You were there in February and it snowed a lot last February.
And they realized that the city never sweeps these Hydranten freely.
But a fellow, a man called Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that was that the inhabitants were walking freely on the pavements, right in front of these parts.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It is a nice little app where you can adopt a Hydranten.
You agree to him freely to scoop when it snows.
If thou doest that thou mayest give him a name, and he called the first Al.
If you don't do that, someone can take it away from you.
So there is a nice little game dynamic.
This is a modest little app.
It is probably the smallest of the 21 apps written by the fellows last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
It is spreading rapidly.
There is this guy in the I.T. department of the city of Honolulu who has seen that he could use this app, not for snow, but to enable the citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It is very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people are stealing the batteries.
This is how he got the citizens to check it.
And then Seattle decided to use the App to get citizens to clean the cramped gullies.
And Chicago has just introduced it so people can sweep the pavements when it snows.
We now know of nine cities that plan to use this app.
And it has spread smoothly, organic, natural.
If you know anything about government technology, you know that it doesn’t usually work that way.
The procurement of software usually takes a few years.
We had a team working on a project in Boston last year which took three people two and a half months.
It was about a method whereby parents can find out which public schools are the right ones for their children.
We were later told that if it were to go through the normal channels it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over USD 2 million.
And that is not enough.
There is a project in California's justice system that has cost taxpayers $2 billion so far and it is not working.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that is written in a few days and then spreads by itself is a kind of shot in the bud on the institution of government.
It shows how government could work better -- no longer like a private company, as many people think it should.
And not even like a technology company, but rather like the Internet itself.
And that means free access, openness and productiveness.
That is important.
But more important of this app is that it represents a new generation that is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of a narrowed institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that is very good news, because it shows that we are very good at collective action with digital technology.
Now there is a large community of people who are producing the tools we need to effectively tackle things together.
It is not just "Code for America" Fellows, there are hundreds of people across the country who stand up and write government apps, every day in their own communities.
They did not give up the government.
They are terribly frustrated with it, but they do not complain about it, they repair it.
And these people know something that we have lost sight of.
And then, if you forget all your feelings about politics and the queue at the employment office and all the other things we are really concerned about, government, in the essence, in the words of Tim O'Reilly, is 'What we do together we cannot do alone'.
Today, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
And if you are one of those people, I ask you to think about it, because things are changing.
Politics is not changing; the government is changing.
And because the government ultimately draws its strength from us -- remember, 'we the people?' -- how we think about it will influence how this change happens.
I did not know very much about government when I launched this program.
And like many people, I thought that government is mainly about electing people into office.
Now, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that it is mainly communities that are concerned about rat droppings.
This is the call center for service and information.
You usually get out of it if you call 311 in your city.
If you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center as our Fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- indeed, they all do -- you'll see people calling the government for many different problems, including a rat in their house.
When the USS Enterprise-D was destroyed, the crew of the Enterprise was able to escape the Nexus.
He entered "Beutelratte" into the official database.
He does not really have an idea, he starts with the pet catcher.
Finally, he says, 'Look, you can just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the cattle are walking away?'
And that worked, applause to Scott.
But that was not the end of the rat race.
Boston has more than just a call center.
It has an app, a web and mobile app, called "Citizens Connect".
We didn't write this app.
This is the work of very smart people in the office of the New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
One day - and this is a real report - this came in: 'Beutelratte in my waste bin, cannot say whether it is dead.
How do I get them removed?"
But what happened with Citizens Connect is different.
Scott spoke from person to person.
But on "Citizens Connect" everything is public so everyone can see it.
And in this case, it saw a neighbor.
And the next entry we got was, "I went over there, found the trash bin behind the house.
They are very interesting and very interesting.
Turned the trash can on the side and went home.
Good night, sweet rat'.
Quite simple.
This is great, because digital meets physical.
It is also a good example of how to get the government into crowdsourcing.
But it is also a great example of government as a platform.
And I do not necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform.
I am talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
One citizen helped another, but the government played a central role here.
She united these two people.
And they could have been linked to government services if they had been needed, but a neighbour is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbour helps another, we strengthen our communities.
Calling the pet keeper costs a lot of money.
One of the most important things that we must remember is that government is not the same as politics.
And most people understand that, but they believe that one is the input of the other.
That our contribution to the system is a choice.
How many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we have spent a lot of energy electing a new political leader - and then we sit back and expect the government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then has not much changed?
That is because government is like a wider ocean and politics are the top 15cm.
And what is underneath that is what we call bureaucracy.
And we use this word with such contempt.
But it is this contempt that makes this thing we own and pay for is something that works against us, something else, and then we deprive ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we must make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that is where the real work of government takes place.
We must get involved in the government machine.
So the OccupytheSEC movement did it.
Have you seen these guys?
It is a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed 325-page report in response to the SEC memo on the bill for financial reform.
That is not politically active, it is bureaucratically active.
Well, for those of us who have abandoned government, it is time for us to think about the world we want to leave to our children.
You have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face.
Do we really believe that we will achieve what we need to achieve without improving the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
A government is absolutely necessary, but it must become more efficient.
The good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally re-interpret government’s function in a way that can actually achieve something by strengthening society.
And there is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it is not so difficult to do things together, just to build the systems properly.
Well, the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, unfortunately, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that grew up taking their voice for granted.
They are not fighting this battle, which we are all fighting, about who can speak; they are all allowed to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time and they do it.
So when they are faced with the government’s problem, they do not care so much about using their votes.
They use their hands.
They use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government.
And these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities.
It could be to scoop a hydrant, weed, turn a garbage bin with a rat.
And surely, we could have scooped these Hydrants out all the time, and many people do.
But these apps are like small digital reminders that we are not just consumers, and we are not just consumers of government, paying taxes and receiving services.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we will not improve government until we improve citizenship.
So the question I have for you all here is: when it comes to the big, important things we have to do together, all together, will we be just a lot of voices, or will we also be a lot of hands?
Thank you.
I usually have to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up will be, and I thought, as I am among friends, I would tell you what I really think, and also try to look back and understand what is going on here, with these incredible jumps forward that are happening so quickly that we can hardly keep up.
I'll start by showing you a single boring slide.
... Could you show the slide briefly?
This is a slide I accidentally selected from my folder.
I am not concerned here with the details of the foil, but rather with the general shape.
This slide shows data from an analysis of the performance of RISC processors compared to the performance of a local area network.
The interesting thing here is that this foil, like many others we often find in our field, is a kind of straight on a semi-logarithmic curve.
In other words, every step here corresponds to a power in the performance scale.
And this is a novelty that we must use this type scale on semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology.
Something very strange is happening here.
That is essentially what I am going to talk about here.
So, if you could please turn the lights on again.
Even brighter, because I will draw something on the paper here.
Well, why do we draw graphs in the technique on semi-logarithmic curves?
The reason for this is that if I draw it on a normal curve where, say, the years are, that is, the time axis of a kind, and this here is any measure of technology that I want to represent with a graph, then the graph becomes silly.
That is how they look.
And that does not tell us much.
If I want to record another technology, say transport technology, then it would come out in the semi-logarithmic scale in the form of a flat line.
But if something like this happens, it changes the qualitative circumstances.
So if transport technology were to advance as fast as microprocessor technology, we could take a taxi the day after tomorrow and in 30 seconds we would be in Tokyo.
But that will not happen quickly.
This is unprecedented in the history of technology development, this kind of recursive growth that increases the scale exponentially every few years.
The question I would like to ask you now is, if you look at these exponential curves, you see that they do not go on forever.
It is not possible for everything to develop forever and forever as quickly as it is now.
There are two options:
Either it will become a classic S-curve like this until something completely new comes out, or it will be this.
That is about that.
Well, I am an optimist, so I think something like this will happen.
If that is really the case, it means that we are in the middle of a transition here at the moment.
We are here on this line, in a transition from the world we have seen to date to a new kind of world.
So the question I want to ask, and I often ask myself, is how this new world will be?
What is this new state that the world is slowly beginning to accept?
Because the transition seems very, very confusing when you are in the middle of it.
When I was a child, the future was somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000.
Now we have a conference where people are talking about the future and it is noted that the future is still in the year 2000.
We cannot go any further than that.
In other words, the future has shrinked by one year every year since I was in this world.
I think the reason for this is that we notice that something is happening.
The transition is happening, and we can all feel it.
And we know that at the moment there is no point in trying to look into the future for 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that simply counting up what we are doing now simply doesn’t make sense.
I would now like to talk about what this might be, this transition in which we are currently engaged.
To do this, I will first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers.
I believe that in order to really understand this we need to go back and look at the matter on a longer scale.
I would like to look at this on the scale of the life of the earth.
I believe that the overall picture makes sense if it is divided into a few billion steps.
So let us go back to 2.5 billion years ago, when the earth was a large, sterile stone clump with many chemicals floating on it.
If you look at the way in which these chemicals were organised, you will have a fairly good picture of how they did it.
I also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with RNA, but I will tell you a simplified story about it which is that at that time small droplets of oil were floating around, containing different kinds of recipes for chemicals.
Some of these oil droplets contained a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow.
All those who were so began to divide.
These small droplets of oil were the most primitive cell form.
However, these oil droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them was just a small, random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it split, the chemicals in it were distributed in unequal quantities.
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the droplets, which had a more optimal composition for growth, grew faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster.
They thus tended to survive longer and they multiplied to a greater extent.
This is therefore only a very simple chemical form of life, but it becomes more interesting when these droplets learned a trick about abstraction.
In some way, which we do not yet fully understand, these droplets have learned the ability to write information.
They have learned to store the cell recipe as information in a specific chemical form called DNA.
In other words, in this mindless evolutionary way, they found a way to write down what they consisted of, so that this information could be stored and copied.
The amazing thing about this is that storing this kind of information remained the same over the 2.5 billion years in which it was created.
In fact, the recipe for us, namely our genes, consists of exactly the same code and the same spelling.
Each living creature uses exactly the same letters and code.
We are now able to write our own stuff in this code, just for fun.
And here I have 100 micrograms of white powder which I try to keep away from security personnel in airports.
In it is – What I did is, I took this code – the code consists of normal letters we use to symbolize – and I wrote my business card on a piece of DNA and reinforced it 10 ^ 22 times.
So if anyone wants one hundred million copies of my business card, I have enough for everyone in this room, and even for everyone in the world, and it is right here.
If I had been an egotist, I would have written it to a virus and released it into the room.
So what is the next step?
The signing of DNA was an interesting step.
And that is what these cells did – it made them happy for another billion years.
But then another very interesting step happened, where things changed completely, namely these cells began to communicate and exchange information, so that communities of cells arose.
I do not know whether you knew that already, but bacteria can indeed exchange DNA.
This is also the reason why, for example, resistance to antibiotics is growing.
Some bacteria have found out how to keep out of penicillin and have written this information into the DNA together with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other.
This communication allowed communities to form which were in a sense in the same boat; they were synergetic.
They either survived together or died together, meaning that when a community was successful, all individuals of the community were repeated more often and preferred by evolution.
The transitional point is now where these communities have moved so close together that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a string on DNA.
And the next interesting phase lasted about another billion years.
At this point we have multi-cell communities, communities of many different cell types that function together as a single organism.
Indeed, we are a multi-scalar community of this kind.
We have many cells that are no longer standing on their own.
Your skin cells are useless without heart cells, muscle cells, brain cells and so on.
These communities thus began to develop, so that the level at which evolution took place was no longer the individual cell, but the whole cell community, which we call the organism.
The next step was taken within these communities.
Cell communities began to abstract information again.
And they developed special structures that did nothing but process information within the organism.
And these are the neural structures.
The nerve cells are the information processing apparatus which these cell communities have built up.
They began to train specialists within the community, special structures responsible for learning, understanding and keeping information.
And that was the brain and nervous system of these communities.
This gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time an individual – learning now happened within the time span of the lifespan of an individual organism, rather than over this evolutionary time span.
An organism could learn, for example, not to eat a particular fruit because it tasted bad and made him ill the last time he ate it.
This could now happen within the lifetime of an individual organism, whereas it took hundreds of thousands of years before, because this information had to be learned evolutionarily by the individuals who died because of this fruit, because these information processing structures were not yet in place.
The nervous system therefore has the evolution process through these special information structures. Evolution could now take place within an individual.
It was possible to take place within a time frame.
What happened afterwards was that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other.
Let us take as an example the most refined version of this communication we know of is human language.
It is a quite astonishing invention if you think about it.
I have a very complicated, disordered and confusing idea in my mind.
I sit here and actually give a glowing sound, in the hope that I will create a similarly confused idea in your mind that is a little similar to my original idea.
So we take something very complicated, we transform it into sounds, a sequence of sounds, and thus produce something very complicated in the minds of others.
This allows us to function as a single organism again.
And what we have actually done, we, the human race, is we have started to abstract.
We are going through the same stages that multicellular organisms have gone through – the abstraction of our methods of storing, presenting, processing data.
The invention of language, for example, was a small step in this direction.
Telephony, computers, video tapes, CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms built in our community to handle this information.
And it unites us all together into something that is much bigger and also capable of developing faster than we have been until now.
Today, evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds.
You've also seen Ty's little evolution example where he showed a bit of evolution in the "Convolution" program, right in front of your eyes.
So we have once again speeded up the time scale.
The first steps of the story I have told you lasted one billion years per piece.
The next steps, such as the nervous system and the brain, took several hundred million years.
Then the next steps, such as language and so on, took less than a million years.
And these next steps, like electronics, seem to take only a few decades.
The process is self-supporting and thus becomes, I believe, auto-catalyst – when something accelerates its changing speed.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
I believe that this is what we are seeing here in this explosive curve.
We see the process feeding itself.
I live professionally from building computers and I know that I could not use the mechanism I use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology.
My current activity is designing objects with such a high complexity that it is impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
I do not know what each transistor does in the connection machine.
It has billions of those.
What I do instead, and what the designers of Thinking Machines do, is we think at a certain abstraction level, we pass it on to the machine and the machine makes something that far exceeds our abilities, better and faster than we could ever do it ourselves.
And it does so in part with methods that we do not even understand properly.
One method which is particularly interesting and which I have used often recently is evolution itself.
In this process we install an evolutionary process in the machine, which takes place in the microsecond range.
To give an example, in the most extreme cases, we can create a program that develops from random instructions.
We say, "computer, please generate one hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions.
Now, please run all these randomly selected instructions, run all programs, and choose those which are closest to my specifications.'
So in other words, I first define what I want.
Let's say I want to sort numbers, that's a simple example I used already.
So find programs that can sort numbers best.
Of course, the chance of randomly selected instructions sorting numbers by chance is very small, so none of the instructions will actually do this.
But one of them may, with a little luck, put two numbers in the right order.
Now I say, "Computer, take the 10 % of the sequences that come closest to my specifications.
Save them, delete the rest.
Now reproduce all the remaining numbers that sorted the numbers best.
And that is with a method of recombining, similar to reproduction."
Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the features of the subroutines from the two programs.
So I have a new generation of programs which have come from combinations of programs which have come a little closer to the specifications than others.
Say, 'Please repeat this process'.
Guess them again.
Perhaps introduce some mutations.
And try it again with another generation.
All these generations only take a few milliseconds.
and so I can let an evolution over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes, or in more complicated cases a few hours.
Finally, I get programs that can sort numbers perfectly.
The fact is, these programs are so much more efficient than any program I could have written by hand.
When I look at these programs, I cannot say how they work.
I have tried to understand them.
They are confusing and strange programs.
But they do the job.
I know and I am quite sure that they do the job because they come from a number of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job.
Because their lives depended on whether they did the job right.
I was once in a 747 with Marvin Minsky, but he picked up a map and said, "Look, look at it.
It says, 'This aircraft is made up of hundreds of thousands of small parts that work together to make your flight safer' Does that not make you more confident?'
We know that a development process is not optimal if it is too complicated.
So we start to rely on computers for a process that is very different from classic engineering.
It allows us to produce things with a much higher complexity than normal methods would allow.
Yet we do not yet fully understand the possibilities of this.
So technology is almost beyond our control.
We are now using these programs to make computers much faster, so that we are able to execute these processes even faster.
So there is a feedback.
It is getting faster and faster and I think that is why it seems so confusing.
Because all of today’s new technologies feed on themselves.
We are lifting it.
We have reached a point which is analogous to the time when single-cell organisms developed into multi-cell organisms.
So we are the apes and we cannot yet fully understand what hell we are actually creating here.
We are in the middle of this transitional stage.
But I really do believe that something will come after us.
I think it is very high-spirited of us to say that we are the end product of evolution.
And I believe we are all part of the creation of whatever comes next.
Well, lunch is coming and I think I will stop here now before I am voted out.
My story begins right here in Rajasthan, about two years ago.
I was under the starry sky in the desert together with Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
We have talked about the fact that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic 'Mahabharata'.
When we Indians wanted to travel, we jumped into a car and swirled over the sky.
Now we are doing it with aircraft.
At that time, when the great Indian warrior prince Arjuna had thirst, he took a bow, shot into the ground and water appeared.
Now we do it with drills and machines.
We came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines.
I was really saddened.
I got a bit afraid of technology.
It worried me that I might lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweeting to my friends.
I thought technology should make magic possible, not kill.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
This piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me.
It became a golden access to a world full of pirates and ships destroyed and images in my imagination.
It seemed as if our fancy watches and cameras stopped us from dreaming.
They prevented us from being inspired.
And so I went into the world of technology to see how I could use it to make magic possible rather than kill.
At the age of 16, I started to illustrate books.
When I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storyteller that can connect readers around the world.
It can know how we think it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together pictures and text, and animation, sounds and touch.
Stories are increasingly being told with more and more sense.
But what do we do with it?
I simply go to Khoya, an interactive iPad app.
It says: 'Place your fingers on any light'.
And so -- Here it says: "This box belongs..." I write my name.
And I become a figure in the book.
Every now and then a letter falls down for me -- and the iPad knows by GPS where I live -- it is addressed to me.
The child in me is really enthusiastic about such possibilities.
I have spoken a lot about magic.
I do not mean wizards and dragons, but the magic of childhood, those ideas we all had as children.
I always found glowworms in a glass quite exciting.
So you have to flip the iPad and let out the glow worms.
And they illuminate the way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child is that an entire galaxy can be embedded in a single sleeve.
And therefore every book and every world here becomes a little sleeve that I draw here to the magic device in the device.
And this opens a card.
Fantasy books have always had cards, but these cards were static.
This map grows and lights up and serves as a guide in the rest of the book.
It also appears in other parts of the book.
I will go into this.
Also it is important for me to create something that is Indian but also very timely.
Here are the apsaras.
We have all heard about fairies and nymphs, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts, the apsaras?
The poor apsaras were trapped in Indra's chambers for thousands of years, in an old scum book.
And we bring them back, in a contemporary story for children.
A story that deals with new matters, such as the environmental crisis.
On the subject of the environmental crisis, a major problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms, at their computers, without going out.
But now, with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
In an interaction of the book, you are sent to a search, where you have to go out and collect pictures of natural objects with the iPad's camera.
As a child I had collections of stumps, stones, pebbles and shells.
Somehow, children do not do that any more.
This childhood ritual is brought back: you have to go out to take a photo of a flower and mark it in a chapter.
In another chapter you have to photograph and mark a piece of bark.
This way you can create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online.
A child in London shows the picture of a fox and says, 'Oh, today I saw a fox'.
A child in India says: 'Today I saw an monkey'.
This creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you have actually taken.
There are a multitude of ways to connect magic, the world and technology.
In the next book we plan an interaction where you use the video of the iPad and see an animation of elves appearing on a plant in front of the house through augmented reality.
At one point the screen fills with sheets.
You have to make the sound of the wind, blow it away and read the rest of the book.
We are all moving towards a world in which the forces of nature are closer to technology and in which magic and technology can come closer together.
We use the energy of the sun.
We bring our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and the magic, fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story.
Thank you.
This is really an extraordinary honour for me.
I spend most of my time with people in detention, prisons or death cells.
I spend most of my time with the socially vulnerable in social housing estates and in places where there is a great deal of hopelessness.
Being here at TED, seeing and hearing how stimulating it is, gave me a lot of strength.
In the short time I was here, one thing became clear to me: TED has an identity.
We can say things here that have a global impact.
And sometimes, when something comes via TED, it gets a meaning and power that it wouldn't otherwise have.
I say this because I believe that identity is very important.
We have seen some fantastic presentations.
I believe that we have learned that the words of a teacher have meaning, but that the words of a committed teacher are particularly meaningful.
As a doctor you can do good things, but as a caring doctor you can do more.
And that is why I want to talk about the power of identity.
I did not learn that when I was a lawyer.
I learned this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a family, a traditional African-American household, dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was a brave, strong woman, she had an effect.
She had the last word in every family dispute.
It was also the starting point of many disputes in our family.
She was the daughter of a slave family.
Her parents were born in Virginia as slaves in the 1840s.
She was born around 1880 and the experience of slavery shaped her worldview very strongly.
My grandmother was strong, but she was also loving.
When I met her as a little boy she came to me and hugged me.
She pressed me so hard that I could barely breathe, and then she let me go.
One or two hours later, when I met her, she came to me and said, »Bryan, do you still feel my embrace?«
And when I said "no", she embraced me again; when I said "yes", she let me rest.
There was something about her that made you want to be always close to her.
The only problem was that she had ten children.
My mother was the youngest of her ten children.
Sometimes when I wanted to spend time with her, it was hard to get her attention.
My cousins ran around everywhere.
I remember being eight or nine when I woke up one morning and went into the living room, all my cousins walking around.
My grandmother sat at the end of the room and stared at me.
At first I thought that this was a game.
I looked at her and smiled, but she looked very serious.
Then she stood up and came over to me, holding my hand and saying, »Come, Bryan, you and I, we have to talk.«
I remember it as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
She took me out and said, »Bryan, I will tell you something, but you must promise that you will not tell it any further.«
I said, »Promised, Grandma.«
She said, "honourable word? " I said, "Yes."
She sat down and looked at me, and said, »I want you to know that I was watching you.«
She said, »I think you are something special.«
She said, »I think you can do anything you want to do.«
I will never forget that.
Then she said, »You only have to promise me three things, Bryan.«
I said, "OK, grandma."
She said, "First tell me you'll always love your mom."
She said, »Your mom is my baby and you must promise that you will always take care of her.«
I respected my mother, so I said, »Yes, grandma, I will do that.«
Then she said, »Next tell me that you will always do the right thing.« even if it is difficult to do the right thing.«
I thought and said, »Yes, grandma, I promise it.«
Finally, she said, "The last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol."
Well, I was nine years old and so I said, »Yes, grandma, I promise it.«
I grew up in the countryside, in the old rural south and I have a brother who is one year older and a sister who is one year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and brought this six pack of beer with him, my sister and I grabbed it and went into the forest with us.
We spent the night there simply spending our time as we would otherwise.
Then he took a cup of beer and offered one to my sister, and she took one, and then they offered one to me.
I said, ‘No, no, no, OK, just do it, I do not want beer’.
My brother said, "Well, do it now, you do everything else we do.
I had something, your sister had something, so go on, drink a beer.'
I said, »I do not want to, just do it.
My brother stood up and stood up.
He said, »What is wrong with you, now drink something.«
Then he looked in my face and said: »Oh no, do you not get mad about having a chat with Grandma?«
I said, »What are you talking about?«
He said, »Oma tells all grandchildren that they are special.«
I was destroyed on the ground.
I will admit something to you.
I probably should not do that.
This may be publicly transmitted.
I am 52 years old and I admit that I have never drunk a drop of alcohol.
I say this not because I believe it is virtuous, but because identity means power.
If we create the right kind of identity, we can tell people around us things they do not believe at first.
We can get them to do things they thought they could not.
Of course, my grandmother would tell all her grandchildren that they are special.
My grandfather was in prison during the Prohibition period.
My uncle died from alcohol-related diseases.
And she believed that these were the issues we should be looking at.
I have tried to say something about our justice system.
This country is different from 40 years ago.
In 1972, 300,000 people were in prison and in prison.
Today, there are 2.3 million.
The United States now has the highest rate of detention in the world.
Seven million people have been released on a suspended basis or with conditional suspension.
I believe that mass detentions have changed our world fundamentally.
Socially weak and black people are despairful and hopeless because of these changes.
One in three black males aged between 18 and 30 is in prison, in prison, on a conditional sentence or with conditional suspension.
In urban communities across the country – from Los Angeles to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington – between 50% and 60% of all black young men are either in prison, in prison, on probation, or with conditional suspension.
However, our system is not only shaped by racial issues, it is also distorted by poverty.
We have a judicial system in that country which treats you much better if you are rich and guilty than poor and innocent.
Assets, not debt, influence the outcome.
Nevertheless, we seem to be quite happy with it.
A policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems.
We lost contact.
I find that interesting.
There are a few very interesting developments.
My own state, Alabama, will permanently deny you the right to vote if you are convicted of crime.
Here, and now in Alabama, 34% of the black male population have permanently lost their voting rights.
We predict that in ten years' time the rate of deprivation of civil honour will be as high as before the adoption of the Electoral Law Act.
The silence is deafening.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States of America is the only country in the world to condemn thirteen-year-old children to death in prison.
In our country, children are given life sentences without conditional suspension.
We have already had a lot of procedures.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in death cells.
The question of the death penalty is an interesting question.
We believe, because we have been taught this way, that the real question is: has a person deserved to die for a crime he committed?
This is a very sensitive issue.
But one can think differently about it, depending on how we see our identity.
The other view is not: has someone deserved death for a crime, but: have we deserved to kill?
I find that fascinating.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
Nine people whom we executed come to one whom we found innocent, who was released and released from death row.
An astonishing error rate: one in nine innocent.
I find that fascinating.
We would never let anyone fly an aeroplane if one of the nine aircraft which took off crashed.
But somehow we manage to get rid of this problem.
It is not our problem.
It is not our burden.
It is not our fight.
I talk a lot about these issues.
I am talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill.
And it is exciting because I teach my students African-American history.
I am talking about terrorism, the period towards the end of the reconstruction, right up to the beginning of the Second World War.
We do not really know very much about it.
But for African Americans in that country, it was a time of terror.
In many areas people have had to be afraid of Lynchmobs.
or from bombs.
It was fear of terror that shaped their lives.
These elderly people are now coming to me and saying, ‘Mr Stevenson, you are talking, you are giving lectures, you are telling people to stop saying that this is the first time in the history of our nation that we are dealing with terrorism: after 11 September’.
You say, ‘No – tell people that we grew up with it’.
And after terrorism, of course, came segregation and decades of racially motivated subjugation and apartheid.
And yet there is a dynamic in our country... we do not like to talk about our problems.
We do not like to talk about our history.
And therefore we do not really understand the significance of our actions in the historical context.
We are constantly clashing.
We are always creating new tensions and conflicts.
We find it hard to talk about race, and I believe that this is because we are not prepared to move closer to the process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people have understood that the segregation cannot be overcome without a willingness to truth and reconciliation.
Even after the genocide in Rwanda, there was such a readiness, but not in this country.
I have given a number of lectures in Germany on the death penalty.
It was fascinating, because one of the scientists stood up after my presentation and said, "You know, it is deeply disturbing to hear you say that."
He said: »In Germany there is no capital punishment.
And of course, it can never be there any more in Germany.”
Then a woman said: »With our history it is impossible that we will ever again speak out in favour of the systematic killing of people.
It would be condescending of us to consciously and deliberately execute people.'
I thought about that.
How it would feel to live in a world where the German state executed people, especially if there were disproportionately many Jews among them.
It would be intolerable.
It would be contemptuous.
Yet here in this country, in the states of the old South, we are turning people – the risk of being sentenced to death is 11 times higher if the victim is white than if it is black; 22 times higher if the accused is black and the victim is white – in the same states where the bodies of lynched people rest on the earth.
And yet there is this mental decoupling.
I believe our identity is under threat.
If we do not deal with these difficult issues, then the positive and wonderful things will also be affected.
We love innovation.
We love technology and creativity.
We love entertainment.
But ultimately, these realities are overshadowed by suffering, abuse, humiliation, exclusion.
I think it is important to combine both.
After all, we are talking about having more hope, more commitment, more dedication to be able to survive in a complex world.
For me, this means taking time to think and talk about the poor, the disadvantaged, those who will never be at TED.
But think in a way that is integrated into our own lives.
We must all believe things that we cannot see.
We do that, however rational we are, however much we appreciate intellect.
Innovation, creativity, and development do not come only from our heads.
They come from ideas driven by the conviction in our hearts.
It is this connection of mind-heart that I believe drives us to be open not only to all the bright and exciting things, but also to the dark and problematic ones.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech politician, once said:
“When we in Eastern Europe fought oppression, we wanted everything possible, but what we needed most was hope, a spiritual orientation, the willingness to be in hopeless places sometimes and to witness.”
This intellectual orientation is at the heart of what I believe the TED communities must also commit to.
There is no boundary between technology and design that allows us to be entirely human unless we have eyes and ears for poverty, exclusion and injustice.
I would warn you that this kind of identity requires a great deal more of us than if we did not take care of it.
It will touch you deeply.
As a young lawyer I have the great privilege of meeting Rosa Parks.
Ms Parks kept returning to Montgomery, where she met two of her oldest friends, those older women, Johnnie Carr, who organized the Montgomery bus boycott – an incredible African-American – and Virginia Durr, a white whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
So these women met and simply talked.
From time to time, Mrs Carr called me and said, »Bryan, Mrs Parks, comes to the city, we want to talk.
Do you want to come and listen?«
And I said, »Yes, very much like it.«
She said, »What will you do when you are here?«
I said, »I will listen.«
And I went over and just listened.
It was always so inspiring, so inspired.
One day I sat there listening to these women and after a few hours, Mrs Parks turned around me and said: "Well, Bryan, tell me what the 'Equal Rights Initiative' is.
What are you trying to achieve?«
I started with my usual talk.
I said: »We are trying to combat injustice.
We want to help people who have been convicted of being innocent.
We want to combat bias and discrimination in the penal system.
We want to abolish life sentence for children without a conditional suspension.
We want to do something about the death penalty.
We want to reduce the number of prisoners.
We want to abolish mass detentions.'
I gave my usual talk and she looked at me and said, »Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm.«
She said, »It will make you very, very tired.«
Then Mrs Carr stood up to me, put a finger on my face and said, »And therefore you must be very, very brave.«
That is why I believe that the TED community should be more brave.
We must find ways of facing up to these challenges: these problems, these suffering.
After all, our humanity depends on humanity of all of us.
In my work I have learned very simple things.
I learned a few simple things.
that we are all more than the worst we have ever done.
I believe that this applies to every human being on the planet.
If someone lies, he is not just a liar.
If someone takes something that does not belong to him, he is not just a thief.
Even those who kill someone are not just murderers.
And because that is the case, there is a fundamental human dignity that the law must respect.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I do not believe that.
I believe that in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice.
Finally, although it is so dramatic, so beautiful, so inspiring, and so stimulating, I believe that in the end we will not be measured by our technology, not by the things we develop, not by our intellect and mind.
Finally, a society is not measured by how it treats its rich and powerful and privileged, but by how it treats the poor, the condemned, the imprisoned.
It is in this context that we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us.
Sometimes I lose my balance.
Sometimes I push too hard.
I am getting tired, as we are all.
Sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking, in a very important way.
I represent these children who have been sentenced to very harsh sentences.
I go to the prison of investigation and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old and who is supposed to be tried as an adult.
Then I wonder how this could happen?
How can a judge turn someone into something he is not?
The judge considers him to be an adult, but I see a child.
One night I stayed too long and thought, my goodness, if a judge can turn us into something else, then he must have spell powers.
Exactly, Bryan, the judge has magical powers.
You should want them too.
And because it was late and I could not think properly, I started working on an amendment.
I had a 14 year old poor black boy as my client.
And I started with this motion, the title of which was: »Amendment to treat my poor 14 year old black client as a privileged white 75 year old top manager«.
in my motion, I stated that misconduct by the public prosecutor and the police and procedural errors should be taken into account.
There was a crazy line about nothing being right in this country, that there is only wrongdoing.
The next morning I woke up and didn't know whether I had just dreamt of this crazy motion or actually written it.
And to my horror, I had not only written it, but also sent it to court.
A few months passed and I had just forgotten everything.
But in the end, my God, I decided to go to court and explain this crazy case.
I went into the car and I was really overwhelmed – overwhelmed.
I went to court.
And I thought it would be so difficult, so painful.
Finally, I got out of my car and went up the stairs to the court.
when I went up the stairs to the court there was an older black man, the courtmaster.
When he saw me, he came over and said, »Who are you?«
I said, »I am a lawyer.« He said, »You are a lawyer?« I said, »Yes.«
He came to me and hugged me.
Then he whispered to me.
He said, »I am so proud of you.«
And I must say that it gave me strength.
It touched something very deeply in me, identity, the ability of each individual to contribute to a community, to a perspective of hope.
Well, I entered the courtroom.
As soon as the judge saw me,
He said, "Mr Stevenson, did you make this crazy request?"
I said, "Yes," and then we started to discuss.
More and more people came in simply because they were angry,
that I wrote these crazy things.
Police officers came in and deputy prosecutors and office workers.
In no time at all, the courtroom was full of people angry that we were talking about colour, about poverty, about inequality.
From my angle of view I saw the housekeeper walking up and down.
He kept looking through the window and heard the whole awful havoc.
He went up and down.
Finally, this elder black man came into the courtroom with a very anxious facial expression and sat right behind me, almost on the defence bench.
Ten minutes later, the judge announced a pause.
During the break, a police officer came in who was disturbed by the fact that the housekeeper was in the courtroom.
This Deputy ran over to the elder black.
He said, »Jimmy, what are you doing in the courtroom?«
The elder black man rose up, looked at the Deputy, then looked at me and said: »I came here to tell this young man, do not lose sight of the goal, do not give up.«
I came to TED because I believe that many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is very loud but that it is moving towards justice.
That we are not fully developed as human beings until we take care of human rights and fundamental values.
That the survival of all of us is linked to the survival of each and every one of us.
That we must combine our visions of technology and design, entertainment and creativity with humanity, compassion and justice.
And, above all, I would simply say to those of you who see it in the same way: do not lose sight of the goal; do not give up.
You have seen and heard an obvious desire among this audience, this community, to help you and do something.
What more can we do?
Bryan Stevenson: Well, there are possibilities everywhere.
If you live in California, there is a referendum this spring which is aimed at making a real effort to divert some of the money flow that otherwise flows into the policy of punishment.
Here, in California, for example, over the next five years, a billion dollars will be spent on the death penalty.
And yet 46% of all killings do not end with arrest.
56% of rape cases do not get to court.
There is an opportunity to do something about this.
This referendum will propose that the money be invested in more security forces and security.
I believe there are opportunities everywhere.
Over the last three decades, crime in America has fallen enormously.
This fact is often linked to the increased number of detainees.
What would you say to anyone who believes that?
Well, in fact, the number of violent crimes has not changed very much.
The majority of mass detentions in that country did not really take place in the class of violent crimes.
It was the misguided crusade against drugs.
Hence the dramatic high numbers of prisoners.
We have become obsessed with the rhetoric of punishment.
Now we have 'three-infringement' laws that put people permanently behind bars for bicycle theft, for the theft of minor goods, rather than forcing them to return the things to the victims.
I believe we must do more to help people who have become victims of crime, not less.
And I believe that our current philosophy of punishment will not help anyone.
I believe that this is what we need to change.
Bryan, you have really played a string here.
You are an inspiring personality.
Thank you for being at TED.
Speaker: Bin Laden’s death brings with it an increased risk of danger.
Speaker 2: famine in Somalia; speaker 3: pepper spray from the police.
Speaker 4: Bad cartels; speaker 5: dangerous cruise ships.
Speaker 6: Social decline; speaker 7: 65 dead.
Speaker 8: tsunami warning; speaker 9: cyber attacks.
Various speakers: drug war, weapons of mass destruction, tornado.
Recession, stagnation, Doomsday, Egypt, Syria.
Crisis, death, disaster.
Oh my God.
So these are just a few of the clips I’ve taken over the last six months – but it could have been the last six days, or the last six years.
The fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds pay attention to these very topics.
And there is also a very good reason for doing so.
Every second of every day, our senses absorb much more information than our brain can ever process.
And because nothing is more important than our survival, the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe, the amygdala.
The amygdala is therefore our early warning system, our danger detector.
It sorts and scans all the information in search of any hint of danger in our environment.
So when we see the news, we prefer to look for negative news.
And the old saying 'if it bleeds, demand rises' is very true.
Well, with all our digital devices giving us all these negative messages seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it is no wonder that we are pessimistic.
It is no wonder that everyone thinks that the world is getting worse and worse.
But perhaps that is not the case.
Perhaps that is the reality.
Perhaps the enormous progress we have made in the last century by a number of forces will accelerate so much that we will be able to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
Well, I am not saying that we do not have major problems – climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy problems – we do.
And as humans, we are much better at anticipating problems in the very long term, but at overcoming them in the end.
Let us look at what we have achieved over the last century to see what will happen.
Over the last 100 years, average life expectancy has more than doubled, and the average income of the world’s population, adjusted to inflation, has tripled.
Child mortality has decreased by one tenth.
In addition, the cost of food, electricity, transport and communications has been reduced many times.
Steve Pinker has shown us that we are living in a very peaceful time in human history.
And, according to Charles Kenny, the literacy rate has risen from 25% to 80% over the past 130 years.
We are living in a truly extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we are constantly increasing our expectations.
Indeed, we have redefined poverty.
Remember that a large proportion of Americans living below the poverty line have access to electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, TVs, mobile phones, air conditioning, and cars.
The richest capitalists of the last century, the empires of the world, could never have dreamt of such luxury goods.
The basis for much of this are technologies, and these are growing exponentially.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil has shown us that any tool that becomes information technology makes big jumps on the Moore Law curve, and the price performance quotient doubles every 12 to 24 months.
Therefore, the mobile phone in your pocket costs around one million times less and is thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
That is Moore’s law of the last hundred years.
Note two things on this curve.
First, how smooth it is – in good times as well as in bad times, war or peace, recession, depression, and boom.
This is the result of faster computers making faster computers.
It will not slow down for any of our major problems.
Furthermore, despite its logarithmic trajectory on the left, it runs upwards.
So the rate of growth itself is accelerating.
And on this curve, on the back of Moore's law, we find a number of extraordinary technologies available to everyone.
Cloud computing, something my friends at Autodesk call 'Infinite Computing', sensors and networks, robots, 3D printers that make it possible to democratize personal production on our planet, synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and food, digital medicine, nanomaterials and artificial intelligence.
How many of you have seen the victory of IBM's supercomputer Watson at "risk"?
That was a great thing.
I went through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines I could find.
I love it: 'Watson defeats human opponents'.
Risk is not an easy game.
It is about understanding the nuances of language.
Imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available to every mobile phone owner.
Four years ago Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university here at TED, called Singularity University.
We teach our students all these technologies, with particular focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of mankind.
And every year we ask students to create businesses, products and services that can positively influence the lives of millions of people within a decade.
Think that a group of students can influence the lives of billions of people today.
Thirty years ago, this would have sounded ridiculous.
Today we can refer to dozens of companies that have achieved this.
When I think of creating wealth, I do not mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet; I mean a life full of opportunities.
It is about making surpluses out of scarce goods.
Shortage is context-related, and technology is a resource liberating force.
Here is an example.
This is the history of Napoleon III in the middle of the 18th century.
He is the type left.
He invited the King of Siam to dinner.
Napoleon's soldiers were given silver cutlery, Napoleon himself was given gold cutlery.
The King of Siam, however, was given aluminium cutlery.
At that time, aluminium was the most precious metal on the planet, more precious than gold and platinum.
This is why the dome of the Washington Monument was made of aluminium.
Although aluminium accounts for 8.3 percent of the earth's mass, it does not exist as pure metal.
It is connected by oxygen and silicon.
But then electrolysis technology was developed and aluminium production became so affordable that we use it with our disposal mentality.
Let us project this analogy into the future.
We are thinking today of energy shortages.
Ladies and gentlemen, we live on a planet which is filled with 5,000 times more energy than we consume every year.
16 terawatts of energy splash into the earth's surface every 88 minutes.
It is not a question of scarcity, the problem is accessibility.
And there is good news.
This year, India has managed for the first time to reduce the cost of solar power by 50% of diesel fuel – 8.8 rupees, compared to 17.
The cost of solar energy fell by 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study showing that by the end of this decade, solar energy will cost $6 per KWh in the sunny areas of the US, compared to $15 on the national average.
And if we have an energy surplus, we will also have an abundance of water.
Let us talk about water wars.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back to Earth in 1990, when it passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo, as it was called.
"A Pale Blue Dot."
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet which is 70 percent covered by water.
Yes, 97.5% of the water is salty, 2% is easily exhausted and we are fighting for 0.5 % of the water on the planet, but there is hope here too.
And there are new technologies, not in 10 or 20 years' time, but now.
New nanotechnologies are on the way, nanomaterials.
And from a conversation this morning with Dean Kaman, one of the innovators of Do It Yourself, I would like to share with you – he gave me the permission – his technology, called a slingshot, which many of you may have heard about, the size of a fridge in a student home.
It can produce a thousand litres of clean drinking water per day from various sources – whether it is salt water, polluted water, latrines – and all for less than 2 cents per liter.
The Coca Cola CEO has just agreed to launch a large test project with a hundred units in developing countries.
And if everything goes well, and I am very confident that it will, Coca Cola, will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the world.
This is technology-supported innovation that exists today.
We have also seen this in the case of mobile phones.
You my goodness, we will soon reach the 70 percent coverage rate of mobile phones in developing countries by the end of 2013.
Just think that a Massai warden with a mobile phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile communication than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And when they search Google on their smartphone, they have more access to knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
They live in a world where information and communication are abundant, as no one could have predicted.
And, even better, the things you and I spent several thousand dollars on – GPS, HD video and photo, libraries full of books and music, medical diagnostics technology – are literally dematerialized and cheaper in your cell phone.
And the best part of it is perhaps what awaits us in the area of health.
Last month I had the pleasure of announceing the so-called "$10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize" with the Qualcomm Foundation.
We challenge teams around the world to combine all these technologies in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device because it is equipped with AI, you can suck in or test your blood levels.
And to win, the device must make a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors.
Imagine this device, in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors, but 25% of the burden of disease and 1.3% of health workers.
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that is not known, it calls the health authority and prevents a pandemic from eruption.
But now to the greatest force that will lead us to a world of abundance.
I call it 'the next billion'.
The white lines are for population.
We have just crossed the 7 billion mark.
By the way, the greatest guarantee against population explosion is better education and nutrition throughout the world.
In 2010, we had just two billion people online.
By 2020, we are expected to grow from two to five billion Internet users.
Three billion new brains, of which we have never heard before, will join global communication.
What do these people need?
What will they consume?
And instead of economic stagnation, I see one of the greatest economic upheavals in history.
These people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy.
And they will be healthier by using the tricoter, and they will be better trained by the Khan Academy, and by having the opportunity to use 3D printers and Infinite Computing, and be much more productive than ever before.
So what can 3 billion growing, healthy, educated, productive members of the human community bring?
What about a sentence of new voices never heard before?
How about giving the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to draw attention to themselves and to generate change, for the very first time?
What will these three billion people bring?
What about contributions that we cannot even predict?
One of the things I learned from the X Prize is that small teams motivated by passion and focus can do extraordinary things, things that large companies and governments have only been able to do in the past.
I would like to end with a story that really thrilled me.
There is a program that some people may already know.
It is a game called Foldit.
It was developed at the University of Washington in Seattle.
And it is a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop.
Depending on its behavior we can predict its structure and function.
And this is very important in medical research.
Until now, this has been a problem for supercomputers.
And this game was played by university professors, etc.
And there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online.
And it showed that human pattern recognition now folds proteins better than the best supercomputers.
And when these people came and looked at who the best protein container in the world was, it was not a MIT professor, nor a CalTech student, it was someone from England, Manchester, a woman who worked as a daytime assistant in a rehab clinic and was the best protein container in the world at night.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me enormous confidence in our future is that today we have more power than individuals to face the great challenges of our planet.
We have access to tools with exponential technology.
We have the passion of a DIY innovator.
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropists.
And we have three billion new heads with whom we can work online to meet the new challenges and do what is needed.
We expect a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I believe that we must take action against a piece of medical culture that needs to be changed.
And I believe that it starts with a doctor and that is me.
And perhaps I've been in business long enough to allow myself to give up a bit of my own false prestige to make this possible.
Before going into the subject of my presentation, however, let us start with a little baseball.
Hey, why not?
We are near the end of the season and are moving towards the World Cup.
We all love baseball, do we?
Baseball is full of great statistics.
And there are hundreds of them.
"Moneyball" will be released soon and will be about statistics and using them to build a great baseball team.
I will refer to a statistic which I hope most of you have heard about.
It is the average performance of the racquet.
We are talking about a 300 when a racquet hits 300.
This means that the player beats 3 out of 10 shots safely.
This means hitting the ball into the field, it gets up, it is not caught, and those who tried to throw the ball to the first base did not do it in time and the runner was in safety.
Three out of 10.
Do you know how to call a 300th in Major League Baseball?
Good, really good, perhaps an all-star.
Do you know how to call a 400th?
That is someone who certainly beats 4 out of 10.
Legendary - like Ted Williams legendary - the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 times during a regular season.
Let us transfer back to my world of medicine, where I feel a little better or perhaps a little less well after I talked about it with you.
Suppose you have a inflammation of the ovaries and you are referred to an surgeon whose average performance is 400 in relation to inflammation of the ovaries.
Somehow, that does not work, does it?
Suppose you live in a certain remote area and you have a beloved person with cramped heart valves and your family doctor refers him to a cardiovascular surgeon whose average vascular performance is 200.
But, but do you know what?
This year it is much better, it is on the upward branch.
And it beats a 257.
Somehow, this does not work.
But I will ask you a question.
What do you think the average performance should be for a cardiology specialist, a nurse, an orthopaedist, a midwife, a rescue assistant?
1.000, very good.
The truth is that no one in the whole of medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or rescue assistant should be.
What we do, however, is to send each of you, myself included, into the world with the claim to be perfect.
Never make a mistake, but no one is concerned about the details of how to do it.
And that is the news I took in my medical studies.
I was a compulsively obsessive student.
In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldmann would study for a blood test.
And that is how it was.
And I took classes in my little rooftop at the Sisters Residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here.
I learned everything by heart.
In my anatomy lecture I learned the origins and branches of every muscle, every branch of every artery that leads away from the aorta, obscure and common differential diagnoses.
I even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renal tubular azithromycin.
And all the time I collected more and more knowledge.
And I was good, I finished cum laude.
And I left the medical school with the impression that if I knew everything and knew everything, or at least as much as possible, as close to completeness as possible, I was immune from making mistakes.
And it worked for a time until I met Mrs Drucker.
I was resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs Drucker was brought to me to the hospital's emergency department.
At that time I was assigned to the cardiac ward in the cardiac service.
And it was my task when the emergency staff sought cardiology advice to examine the emergency patient.
And to give feedback to my chief doctor.
I looked at Mrs Drucker and she was in a state of breath.
And as I heard her she made a shivering sound.
And when I heard her chest with the stethoscope, I heard a cracking sound on both sides, which told me that she suffered from congestive heart failure.
This is a state where the heart fails to pump all the blood further, and instead of pumping all the blood further, some of the blood settles in the lung and fills it gradually, hence the shortness of breath.
And that was not a difficult diagnosis.
I put it and went on to the treatment.
I gave her aspirin, I gave her medicine to take the pressure off her heart.
I gave her medicine we call diuretics, water tablets, so she chose the liquid.
And over a period of one and a half to two hours, she began to feel better.
I felt really good.
And then I made my first mistake; I sent them home.
I did in fact make two mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to my chief doctor.
I did not pick up the listener and did what I should have done, which would have been a call to my chief doctor to clarify it with him so that he would have had a chance to get his own picture.
And he knew it, he would have been able to contribute additional information to it.
Perhaps I did so with good reason.
Perhaps I did not want to be the doctor in need.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and so able to take on his responsibilities that I acted in that way and so I would be able to care for my patients without having to contact them.
My second error was worse.
By sending them home, I disregarded a quiet voice in me who tried to say to me, 'Goldman, no good idea, don't do it'.
In fact, I was so lack of self-assurance that I asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs Drucker, 'Do you think it is OK for her to go home?'
And the nurse thought about it and said in a factual way, 'Well, I think she will be well'.
I remember it as if it was yesterday.
So I signed the redundancy papers and an ambulance and rescue assistants came and brought them home.
And I returned to work.
The rest of the day, the evening, I had this nagging feeling in my stomach.
But I continued to work.
And at the end of the day I packed my things, left the hospital and went to the parking lot to drive home, when I did something I wouldn't do otherwise.
I went through the emergency department on my way home.
And then another nurse, not the nurse who had seen Mrs Drucker, but another, said three words to me and these three words are feared by most emergency doctors I know.
Other doctors fear them as well, but emergency medicine is especially special because we see patients only so fleeting.
The three words are: remember?
'Do you remember the patient you sent home?'
The nurse asked objectively.
So she is back, you said in this particular tone.
So she was back.
She was back and dying.
Around one hour after she arrived at home, after I sent her home, she collapsed and the family called 911 and the rescue workers took her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50, which is a dangerous state of shock.
She barely breathed and had started to become blue.
The emergency staff pulled all the strings.
They gave their blood pressure increasers.
They connected them to the ventilator.
I was shocked and utterly disturbed.
And I went through this rollercoaster because she came to ICU after stabilization and I hoped she would recover.
And after two or three days it became clear that you would never wake up again.
She had suffered untreatable brain damage.
Their family gathered.
And over the next eight or nine days, they surrendered to what had happened.
On the next day they let them go -- Mrs. Drucker, a woman, a mother and grandmother.
It is said that you never forget the names of those who die.
And that was the first time I learned this myself.
The next few weeks I made accusations and I first experienced the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- I felt alone, isolated, not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you cannot talk about it with colleagues.
You all know the healthy shame of revealing a secret of your best friend, even though he asked you to keep it secret and you are caught and the best friend confronts you with it and my awful discussion, but when you end up with a bad conscience and you swear that you will never make such a mistake again.
If you make a reparation and never make the mistake again.
That is the kind of instructive shame.
The unhealthy way I am talking about is the one that makes you sick in the deepest.
It is the one who tells you that it is not what you have done that is bad, but that you are bad yourself.
And that was what I felt.
And it was not because of my chief doctor, he was very kind.
He talked to the family and I am sure he calmed the waves and made sure that I would not be taken to court.
But I asked myself these questions from then on.
Why did I not ask the chief doctor, why did I send her home?
And then in my worst moments: how could I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go to medicine?
Slowly but surely, it was going well.
I started to feel better.
And then on a cloudy day, there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out and I thought I might feel better again.
And I acted with myself that if I doubled my efforts to perfection and never made a mistake again, the voice could become mute.
And she did.
And I continued to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later, I was in the emergency room in a municipal hospital north of Toronto and I looked at a 25-year-old man with irritated throats.
There was a lot of things going on and I was in a hurry.
He always pointed towards this.
I looked in the throat and it was a little bit pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on.
And as he went out of the door he looked at his throat.
Two days later I came to my next emergency service and my chief doctor asked me to come to her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
'Do you remember the patient with the irritated throat?'
It turned out that he had a streptococcal infection.
He had a potentially life-threatening disease called epiglottitis.
You can google it, but it is not infection of the throat but of the upper respiratory tract and causes the closure of the respiratory tract.
Fortunately, he did not die.
He was given intravenous antibotica and recovered a few days later.
And I went through the same torture of shame and self-doubt, felt liberated and went back to work until it happened again and again and again.
In an emergency room I twice overlooked a catarrhal inflammation.
There is a lot to be said about this, especially if you consider that you work in a hospital which had only 14 patients per night at that time.
In both cases I did not send them home and there were no faults in their treatment.
In one I thought he had kidney stones.
I ordered the kidney x-ray, and when it did not appear, my colleague re-examined the patient and found a hardening in the lower right sector and called the surgeon.
The other had severe diarrhoea.
I ordered fluids to rehydrate it and asked my colleagues to look at it as well.
And he did so, and when he saw a hardening in the lower right sector he called the operators.
In both cases they were operated on and they were going well.
Both cases gnawed at me, devoured me.
And I would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years, which many of my colleagues claim, but it is total nonsense.
Some of my knits have happened in the last five years.
They are alone, ashamed and without support.
This is the problem: if I cannot finish with my mistakes and talk about them, if I cannot find the silent voice telling me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them my mistakes so that they do not commit the same?
If I go into a room -- as I'm doing now, I don't know what you think about me.
When did you last hear someone talk about failure over failure over failure?
Oh yes, they go to a cocktail party and you may hear about some other doctor, but you won't hear anyone talk about your own mistakes.
If I went into a room full of colleagues and asked for their immediate support and started telling them what I have just told them, I would very probably not get to the end of the second story before they really got uncomfortable, somebody would insert a joke, they would change the subject and forget the rest.
Indeed, if I or my colleagues knew that an orthopaedist had removed someone's wrong leg in my hospital, they would think I would have trouble looking him in the eye.
That is the system we live in.
It is a total denial of mistakes.
It is a system in which there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and those who do not, those who restrict sleep lack and those who do not restrict sleep lack, those with poor results and those with good results.
It is almost an ideological reaction, like antibodies attacking a human being.
And there is the idea that if we banish those who make mistakes from medicine, we will have a safe system.
But there are two problems.
In my about 20 years of medical awareness and journalism, I created a personal medical study of medical errors and wrong treatments to learn everything possible for one of my first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show "White Coat, Black Art".
And what I learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevitable.
We work in a system where errors occur every day, where one in ten medications is either incorrect or incorrectly dosed, where hospital infections are increasingly common and cause destruction or death.
In this state, around 24,000 Canadians die from avoidable mistakes.
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine estimates the figure at 100,000.
Both are serious understatements because we are not looking at the problem as closely as we should.
And is the crux.
We cannot keep up with a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two or three years.
Lack of sleep is ubiquitous.
We cannot get rid of it.
We have a cognitive error so we can take a perfect course of illness for a patient with breast pain.
Then I take the same patient with a breast pain, make him sweaty and swallowy, add a slightly alcoholized breath and suddenly the story is sprinkled with contempt.
I do not follow the same course.
I am not a robot; I do not always do things in the same way.
And my patients are not cars; they do not always report their symptoms to me in the same way.
All of this combined makes mistakes unavoidable.
So if you take the system as I was taught it to do and sort out all the health professionals who are flawed, then no one will be left in the end.
And do they know the tales of people who do not want to talk about their worst cases?
In my show "White Coat, Black Art," I have the habit of saying "This is my worst mistake" I would say to everyone from the rescue assistant to the chief doctor of the cardiology, "This is my worst mistake" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
And then their pupils expand, they have stood in front of their heads, then they look down and swallow hard, and start to tell their stories.
You want to tell your stories, you want to share your stories.
They want to be able to say, 'Look, do not make the same mistakes that I made'.
What they need is an environment that makes them able to do so.
What they need is a new medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor.
The newly defined doctor is a person who knows about his humanity, accepts it, is not proud of making mistakes, but does everything to learn from them so that it can be passed on.
She shares her experience with others.
It supports when others talk about its mistakes.
And she shows others their mistakes, not to expose them, but in a loving, supportive way so that everyone benefits.
And she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people breathe life into the system and, if so, people make mistakes from time to time.
So that the system develops to create backups that make it easier to detect errors that people make inevitable and also to create loving, supportive spaces where anyone who observes the health system can actually address matters that are potential errors and even be rewarded for them, especially for people like me who make errors and should be rewarded for improving them.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am the newly defined doctor.
I am a human being, I make mistakes.
I am sorry but I try to learn as much as possible to pass it on to others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
Let me conclude with three of my own words: I remember.
I will talk about a tiny, small idea.
It is about variable standard values.
And because this idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories beforehand, to take advantage of the time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
You know that he was here in 1835.
You may think he was hunting finches, but that is not true.
He actually collected fish.
He described one of them as very "ordinary".
It was a chunked bark.
Until the 1980s, it was fished in large scale.
Now it is on the Red List of Endangered Species.
This is a story we have heard many times from the Galápagos Islands or from other places, it is not very special.
Nevertheless we still come to the Galápagos Islands.
We still think they are original.
The brochures still describe it as untouched.
What has happened here?
The second story is intended to illustrate another concept, the waistline which can be changed.
I experienced it when I studied a lagoon in West Africa in 1971.
I went there because I grew up in Europe and wanted to work in Africa later.
I thought I could integrate.
And I got a severe sunburn and I was convinced that I didn't really come from there.
It was my first sunburn.
As you can see, the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees and a few mangroves.
There were cichlids of about 20 centimeters, blackfin maul brooders, a subspecies of cichlids.
The fishing grounds of these cichlids were very profitable and the fishermen lived well from it and made a better living than average in Ghana.
When I returned there 27 years later, the fish had halved its size.
They measure five centimeters tall.
They had been genetically suppressed.
They were still fish.
People were still happy.
And the fish was also lucky enough to be there.
So nothing has changed, and yet everything has changed.
My third little story is about my complicity in the introduction of trawling in South-East Asia.
In the 1970’s – rather the early 1960’s – Europe supported many development projects.
Fisheries promotion meant countries that already caught 100 000 fish industrial fishing This pretty ugly ship is called Mutiara 4.
I was there and we made surveys throughout the southern South China Sea and especially in Java.
We had no words for what we found there.
I now know that it was the cause of the sea.
90 percent of our catch was sponges, other animals connected to the ground.
Most of the fish, the small points on the rubble, the rubble ditches, were coral reefs.
In essence, the bottom of the sea came on deck and was then thrown back.
These pictures are extraordinary, because the transition is very quick.
Within a year, a survey is carried out and commercial fishing begins.
The bottom is changed, making a hard bottom or soft coral into a sticky waste.
This is a dead turtle.
They were not eaten, they were throwing them away because they were dead.
Once we caught one alive.
It had not yet drowned.
Then they wanted to kill them, because they could eat them well.
In fact, this mountain of rubble is collected every time fishermen go to areas where there has never been a fishing season.
However, it is not documented.
We are changing the world, but we do not remember it.
We adapt our standards to the new level and do not remind ourselves of what was there.
If we generalize it, the following happens.
On the y axis are a few good things: biodiversity, number of orcas, the green of your land, the water supply.
It changes over time, because people take their actions for granted.
Every generation regards the images they take at the beginning of their conscious life as the standard and will deduce everything from it.
The difference is then perceived as a loss.
But they do not notice the previous losses.
There may be a sequence of changes.
And in the end, you only want to preserve the pitiful remnants.
That is now, to a large extent, our goal.
We want to preserve things that have disappeared or things that are no longer as they were.
One might think that the problem was people who, when they were living in predatory societies, certainly killed animals and only a few generations later became aware of what they had done.
It is obvious that an animal that was very common becomes rare before it dies.
You don't lose any animals that are common.
You always lose rare animals.
And therefore it is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time we focus on the big animals and in the sea the big fish.
They are becoming rarer because we are catching them.
With time, there is little fish left and we think that is the standard.
The question is why people accept that.
Well, because they do not know that it was once different.
Of course, many people, scientists, will confirm that it was really different.
You will confirm it, because the evidence as it was in a previous form is not as you would like to describe it.
There is the anecdote, for example, that the report by a captain Soundso, who observed large amounts of fish in this area, cannot be used, or is not normally evaluated by fishery scientists because it is not'scientific'.
We therefore have a situation where people do not know the past, even though we live in a society of understanding, because they do not trust the sources of the past.
This shows the enormous role that a marine reserve can play.
Because marine protected areas are actually a way of restoring the past.
We are reconstructing the past, which people cannot understand because the standards have changed and are very low.
This will allow people who see a marine protected area and who benefit from the insight it offers to reset their standard values.
What about those who cannot do this because they do not have access – the people of the Middle West, for example?
Here, I think, the art and the film can fill the gap, as well as simulations.
This is the simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
Grey whales were there a long time ago – 500 years ago.
And the colours and shades may remind you of "Avatar".
When you think of "Avatar", when you think of why people were so touched by it – apart from the Pocahontas story, why were they so touched by the world of images?
Because it calls to mind something that has been lost in a way.
So my recommendation, the only one I will give, is for Cameron to make Avatar II underwater.
Thank you.
In the 1980s, in the Communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter, you had to register it with the government.
You also had to register a sheet of sample text from this typewriter.
The reason for this is that the government was able to trace where a text came from.
If they found an article with false thoughts, they could track down the author of the thought.
And we in the West could not understand how anyone could do that and how much it would restrict freedom of speech.
We would never do that in our own countries.
But if you buy a new color laser printer from the leading laser printer manufacturers today in 2011 and print a page, that page has bright yellow spots on each page, in a pattern that clearly trace the page to you and your printer.
That is what is happening to us today.
And no one seems to be concerned about that.
And that was an example of how our own governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And that is one of the three main sources of the online problems that exist today.
Let us look at what is really happening in the world: we can divide the attacks into categories.
We have three main groups.
There are online criminals.
Here, for example, Mr Dimitry Golubow from Kiev in Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These people earn money.
They use online attacks to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are several well-known cases of online millionaires, multi-millionaires who have made their money through attacks.
Here is Vladimir Tsastsin from Tartu in Estonia.
That is Alfred Gonzalez.
Stephen Watt.
Björn Sundin.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so forth.
These people have made a living online, but they have earned it illegally, using Trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do our online banking, or keyloggers to gather credit card information when we enter it via the keyboard while we shop online via an infected computer.
Two months ago, the US intelligence service frozen Mr Sam Jain's Swiss account here, and there were USD 14.9 million in that account when it was frozen.
Mr Jain himself is at large, but his place of residence is unknown.
And I would say that today we are more likely to be the victims of an online crime than of a crime in the real world.
It is very clear that this will only get worse.
In the future, most crime will be done online.
The second largest group of attackers we are seeing today are not motivated by money.
They are motivated by something else - protests, an opinion, or by their audience.
Groups like Anonymous have risen over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attacks.
Those are the three main groups of attack: criminals who do it for the sake of money, hacktivists like Anonymous who resist it, but the last group are nations, governments, who are leading the attacks.
We have cases such as DigiNotar.
It is an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens.
DigiNotar is a Dutch authority certificate – or was it.
Last autumn it had to file for bankruptcy because DigiNotar had been hacked.
Someone broke in and had thoroughly hacked the system.
Last week, at a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of that group whether he thought it possible that people had died as a result of the DigiNotar hack.
And his answer was 'Yes'.
Well, how do people die as a result of such a hack?
DigiNotar is a certification body.
You sell certificates.
What do you do with certificates?
Well, you need a certificate if you have a web site with HTTPS, with SSL-encrypted services, for example Gmail.
Now we all, or many of us, use Gmail or one of its competitors, but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign providers like Gmail because they know they can trust them more than local providers and that they are encrypted via SSL connections so that the local government cannot fidget in their conversations.
They can, however, if they become a foreigner.
Certification Authority hacking and issuing fake certificates.
And that is what happened in the case of DigiNotar.
What about the Arab Spring and what has happened in Egypt, for example?
Well, in Egypt, in April 2011, the insurgents looted the headquarters of Egypt’s secret police, and found a lot of files.
In these files was a folder called "FINFISHER".
And that folder contained notes from a German company that had sold the Egyptian government a few programs that allowed them to intercept – on a very large scale – any communication from Egyptian citizens.
They sold this programme to the Egyptian Government for EUR 280,000.
The headquarters of the company is right here.
So Western governments provide totalitarian governments with tools to act against their own citizens.
But Western governments also help themselves.
For example, in Germany only a few weeks ago, the so-called state Trojan was found, a Trojan used by German government officials to spy on their own citizens.
If you are suspected of being involved in a crime, your phone will almost certainly be called.
But today we are far beyond that.
You tap your internet connection.
They use means such as the State Trojan to play your computer with a Trojan that allows them to monitor all your communication, listen to your online discussions, collect your passwords.
So if we continue to think about such things, people's obvious answer would be: 'OK, that sounds bad, but it does not concern me because I am a good citizen.
I do not need to worry!
I have nothing to hide.'
And this argument makes no sense.
Private life must be guaranteed.
Private life is not at issue.
It is not a choice between privacy and security.
It is a choice between freedom and control.
And while we may trust our governments today, in 2011, every right we give is for ever.
And do we trust, do we trust blindly, in any future government, a government that we may have in fifty years' time?
These are the issues we must address over the next 50 years.
It may seem strange to you, but I am a great fan of concrete blocks.
The first concrete blocks were produced in 1868 and came from a simple idea: modules of cement with fixed dimensions that fit together.
Concrete blocks quickly became the most used building unit in the world.
They enabled us to build things that were bigger than us, buildings, bridges, stone after stone.
In essence, the concrete brick had become the brick of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LEGO came out with this.
It was called the "automatic connecting stone".
And within a few years, LEGO moved into every household.
It is estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced - or 75 stones for every person on this planet.
You do not need to be an engineer to create beautiful houses, beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it possible for everyone.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete brick, the brick of the world, and made it a brick for our imagination.
Meanwhile, the next revolution, the next building block, was announced at Bell Labs in the same year.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static, pile-on bricks to a world in which everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows us to build much larger, more complex circuits, one stone after another.
But there is one major difference: the transistor was only for experts.
Personally, I do not accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts and I therefore decided to change that.
Eight years ago I was at the Media Lab and I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started to develop littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules that have a specific function.
They are prefabricated to be light, sound, motor and sensor.
And the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets.
This way you cannot put them in the wrong way.
The stones are colorcoded.
Green is output, blue is electricity, pink is input and orange is cable.
All you need to do is to connect a blue and a green and you can build larger circuits very quickly.
They add a blue to a green and they can make light.
You can insert a switch in between and you have created a small dimmer.
Take the switch out to insert a pulse module, which is here, and you have made a small flash.
Add this buzzer for an additional effect and you have created a noise machine.
I will stop it.
In addition to playing a simple game, littleBits is actually quite powerful.
Instead of having to program, wire or solder, littleBits allows you to program with simple, intuitive gestures.
To accelerate or slow the flash, just turn on this button and it will make the flash faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits is that it is a growing library.
We want to turn every single interaction in this world into a stone that is ready for use.
Lights, sounds, solar elements, motors -- everything should be available.
We have distributed littleBits to children and seen them play with them.
And it was an incredible experience.
The most beautiful thing is how they start to understand the electronics that surround them in their daily lives and that they do not learn in school.
For example, how night light works, why the doors of the lift remain open, or how an iPod reacts to touch.
We also brought littleBits to design schools.
So we had designers with no experience in electronic things, for example, who started playing with littleBits as material.
Here we see, with felt, paper and water bottles, Geordie...
A few weeks ago we brought littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers who had no technical experience - just cardboard, wood and paper - and told them: "Do something".
Here is an example of a project they did, a movement-controlled confetti cannon.
But wait, this here is really my favorite project.
It is a hump of nettle, which is afraid in the dark.
For these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became simply another material.
And we want to make this material available to everyone.
So littleBits is open source.
You can go to the website, download all the design templates and create them yourself.
We want to encourage the world of creators, inventors, contributors, because this world in which we live, this interactive world, belongs to us.
So, get on and start inventing.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, one morning I was woken by the sounds of bright joy.
My father listened to BBC news on his small, grey radio.
He looked very happy, which was quite unusual at that time, when news usually depressed him.
He shouted: 'The Taliban are gone!'
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I will never forget that morning.
A real school.
The Taliban took power in Afghanistan when I was six and banned girls from going to school.
For five years, therefore, I covered up as a boy and accompanied my older sister, who was no longer allowed to go out alone, to a secret school.
Only in this way could we both go to school.
Every day we took a different path, so no one could guess where we were going.
We hid our books in shopping bags so that it looked as if we were just shopping.
We were taught in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In winter it was cosy, but in summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, pupils and our parents.
Time and again, the lessons suddenly had to be suspended for one week because the Taliban had created suspicion.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Did they persecute us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very fortunate to grow up in a family where education was important and daughters were appreciated.
My grandfather was well ahead of his time.
A remote provincial of Afghanistan, an outsider who insisted on sending his daughter – my mother – to school and was broken by his father.
My educated mother became a teacher.
That is it.
Two years ago she retired just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father – to be seen here – was the first in his family ever to receive schooling.
It was always clear to him that his children would receive education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk not to send his children to school.
I still know that during the years under the Taliban, I was sometimes so frustrated by our lives, by the constant fear and the lack of prospects,
When I went to school, I was told that I had a good desire to give up, but my father said, "Daughter, listen to me, you can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen from your money, you can be driven out of your home in war.
But one thing will always remain for you: what is in it, and even if we have to pay your school fees with our blood, we will do so.
So, do you still want to give up?"
Today I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country destroyed by decades of war.
Less than 6% of my age's women have a higher secondary education and, if my family had not been so hard at work in getting me to school, I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here today, as a proud Middlebury College graduate.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was outraged by his family for daring to send his daughters to school, was one of the first to congratulate me.
He boasts not only of my university degree, but also of being the first woman to drive him through Kabul by car.
My family believes in me.
I have great dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
That is why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women’s education.
That is why I helped to set up SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where schooling is still a risk.
It is wonderful to see how the pupils at my school are eager to take advantage of all the opportunities offered to them.
And to see their parents and fathers stand up for them, as my parents did for me, despite and against all the deterrent resistance.
Like Ahmed, he is not his real name and I cannot show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Almost a month ago, his daughter and he were on their way from SOLA to their village and they escaped the death of a bomb on the roadside in just a few minutes.
When he arrived at home, the phone rang and a voice threatened him that if he continued to send his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, 'Kill me now if you will, but I will not jeopardize my daughter's future because of your old and outdated ideas.
As far as Afghanistan is concerned, I have recognized something that is often dismissed in the West: behind most of us who have success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that her success is also his success.
This does not mean that our mothers do not play an important role in our success.
Instead, they are often the ones who initially and convincingly advocate a promising future for their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, men’s support is essential.
Under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school – because it was illegal.
Today, however, over three million girls are sitting in school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from America’s point of view.
Americans understand how uncertain such changes are.
I fear that the changes will not last and that everything will change again with the withdrawal of US troops.
However, when I am in Afghanistan, when I see the pupils in my school and their parents who are standing up for them, who are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is, for me, a country of hope and unlimited possibilities, and the girls who visit SOLA remind me of that every day.
Like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including professionally – my life – was marked by seven years of working in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 – I look young but I am not – I worked on technical cooperation projects with African countries in Zambia, Kenya, the Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every single project we set up failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years old, thought that we Italians were good people and did good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we touched.
Our first project, which inspired my first book "Ripples from the Zambezi", was one in which we Italians wanted to show the people of Zambia how to grow food.
We arrived in Southern Zambia with Italian seeds, in this stunning valley that leads to the Sambesi River, teaching the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and...
Of course, the residents were not interested at all, so we paid them for working and sometimes they appeared.
We were amazed that there was no agriculture in such a fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they did not grow anything, we simply said 'thank God we are here!'
'Just in time to save the people of Zambia from starvation'.
Of course, everything went well in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomatoes, which became so big in Italy, and so big in Zambia.
We could not believe it and said to the Sámi 'Look how easy agriculture is'.
When the tomatoes were ripe and red, about 200 Nile horses came out of the river overnight and devoured everything.
We said to the Sámi: 'Oh God, the Nile ponies!'
And they said, 'Yes, that is why we do not have agriculture here'.
'Why did you not tell us?' 'You never asked us'.
I thought we Italians were so foolhardy in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.
We fed the Nile horses at least.
You should see the nonsense – – You should see the nonsense that we have brought to the unsuspecting African people.
You should read the book 'Dead Aid' by Dambisa Moyo, who is a Zambian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We donor countries have given the African continent EUR 1.5 trillion over the last 50 years.
I will not tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
Read from an African woman what we have done.
We Westerners are imperialists, colonists, missionaries, and there are only two ways in which we treat people: we patronise them or we are patriarchal.
Both words come from the Latin root "pater", which means "father".
But they have two different meanings.
Patriarchal: I treat each other as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronising: I treat everyone from another culture as if they were my servants.
That is why white people in Africa are called "bwana", boss.
I was taken to a height when I read Schumacher's book Small is Beautiful, which said that, especially in economic development, if people do not want help, then let them go.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the man who opened this conference put a bar on the floor and asked: 'Can you imagine a city that is not neo-colonial?'
When I was 27, I decided to respond only to people and invented a system called corporate promotion, where no action is initiated, no one is motivated, but you become the service provider of the local passion, the servant of the local people who dream of becoming a better person.
What you do – you keep your mouth shut.
You never reach a community with ideas, you get together with the locals.
We do not work from offices.
We meet in cafes, we meet in pubs.
We do not have an infrastructure.
We make friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like it, what should you do?
The passion for the individual's own growth is the most important thing.
The passion for growing oneself is the most important thing for mankind.
We help them to find the knowledge, because no one can succeed on his own.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it is available.
Many years ago I had this idea: why, instead of coming to a community and telling people what they should do, why do we not listen to them?
Let me tell you a secret.
There is a problem with municipal assemblies.
Entrepreneurs will never participate and they will never publicly say what they want to do with their money, what opportunities they see.
Planning has this blind spot.
The most intelligent people in the community are not known because they never appear at public meetings.
We are working one-on-one, and in order to do this, a social infrastructure must be created, which does not exist.
A new profession must be created.
This is the company’s chief medical officer, the chief medical officer of the company, who is sitting with you in the house, at your kitchen table and in the café, helping you find the means to transform your passion into a way of living.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I graduated at the time and tried to escape the silly manner in which we tell others what to do.
I went to the fishing village of Perth and asked him to help me, because he was a Maori, and I told him that he was smoke-fishing in a garage, and that he was a Maori, and I helped him sell to a restaurant in Perth and get organised.
I helped these five fishermen to work together and not sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents/kilo, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars/kilo, and the farmers came to me and said, 'Hey, you helped them, can you help us?'
In a year I had 27 projects running, and the government came to ask me: "How do you do that?
How do you do...?" I said: "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I keep my mouth open and listen to them'.
So, so the government says, 'Do it again'.
We have done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We have helped 40 000 companies to start up.
There is a new generation of businesses which are going to go without.
Peter Drucker, one of the best corporate consultants in history, died at the age of 96 a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before he was involved in business, and he said that planning is in fact incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and the economy."
Planning is the death kiss of the entrepreneurial spirit.
So they are rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people of Christchurch want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to come to you.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy, you have to be great at helping them, and they will come in droves.
In a municipality of 10 000 people we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
For which presentation did you applaud most this morning?
Local, passionate people, whom you applauded.
I would say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go about it.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution – non-renewable fossil fuels, manufacturing – and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The incinerator is not sustainable.
The Freon type of maintenance is not sustainable.
We must look at how we can feed, heal, educate, transport and correspond with seven billion people in a sustainable way.
The technologies for doing so do not exist.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution?
The government? forget it!
They will be entrepreneurs, and they are doing so now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years' time, the conclusion being the same: the city of New York would not exist in 100 years' time.
They looked at the curve and said that if the population were to continue to grow at this rate, they would need six million horses to transport people, and it would be impossible to deal with the rubble of six million horses.
They have already gone to the rubble.
In 1860 they see the dirty technology that sucks life from New York.
40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 car manufacturers in the USA – 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race.
Henry Ford, a pioneer in the automobile industry, a pioneer in the automotive industry.
There is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they must be offered discretion.
Otherwise they will not come and talk to you.
Next, you must offer them a genuine, committed and passionate service.
Then you must tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, everyone must be able to do three things: the product to be sold must be grandiose, the marketing must be grandiose and the financial accounting must be huge.
Do you think?
We have never met a single person who can produce, sell and look after the money at the same time.
This does not exist.
This person was never born.
We have done research and looked at the 100 most iconic companies in the world – Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the New Companies, Google, Yahoo.
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, and that is that none was founded by just one person.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in Northumberland entrepreneurship and we start the lesson by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography.
Never "I" and 32 times "we".
He was not alone when he began.
No one started a company on his own.
We can create a community where mediators with a small business background sit in cafes and bars, your dedicated friends who will do for you what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this epic, someone who will say to you: "What do you need?
What can you do?
Okay, can you sell it, can you look after the money?"
"Oh, no, I cannot." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support the business intermediaries in helping them find the means and people to help them find the means and we have found that the miracle of the intelligence of the local population makes the culture and economy of this community change only by capturing the passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago I learned how it must be to be Alice in Wonderland.
Penn State University asked me – a Communication teacher – to teach engineering students about communication.
I was afraid –
Fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big words, with which I am not familiar.
But as the conversation developed, I felt like Alice kneeling down to the rabbit hole and seeing a door to a completely new world.
I was amazed at the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this wonderland.
I believe that great communication is needed to open this door.
We absolutely need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones who are going to tackle our biggest problems, such as energy, the environment and health, and if we do not know and do not understand it, then we will not make any progress, and I believe that it is our responsibility as non-scientists to seek these discussions.
But these great talks will not come about unless our scientists and engineers invite us to their wonderland.
So scientists and engineers, please, clarify matters.
I will show you a few ways to do it, so that we can see that the science and the technology you are working on is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is: well, and what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Tell us not only that you are examining trabecles, but also that you are examining trabecles, the masonic structure in our bones, because it is important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And when you describe what you do, avoid technical words.
Technical words are an obstacle to your thoughts.
Of course you could use "spatial and temporal", but why not just say "spatial and temporal", which is much more understandable for us?
To make your thoughts understandable is not the same as to lower your level.
As Einstein said, "do things as simple as possible – but not easier."
You can tell us about your scientific field without compromising.
Examples, stories, and analogies are a few things to consider, so you can capture us.
And when you present your work, leave the keywords out.
Have you ever wondered why it is called "point of reference"?
When someone smokes, another person is stunned, and you are able to fool your audience with these points.
A film like this is not only boring, but also places too much emphasis on the language processing part of our brain, and we are quickly overburdened.
This sample film by Genevieve Brown is much more effective, showing that the specific structure of the trabecles is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy-to-read sentence to guide the audience whenever they lose the thread, using images and graphics that also appeal to our other senses and thus create a deeper understanding of what you are describing.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open this door and see the wonderland that science and technology entails.
Since the engineers I trained have taught me to make close contact with the "nerd in me", I would like to sum it up with an equation.
Remove your keywords and keywords from your science, divide them by relevance, so tell the audience what is important, and multiply it with the passion you have for your incredible work: and this leads to unimaginable interactions full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you have solved this equation, please clarify me.
Thank you.
Hi, this is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change a life and give you personal freedom.
A mobile phone can film a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest action in Egypt.
And with a mobile phone you can record a song, upload it to SoundCloud and become famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile phone.
I was born in 1984 and live in Berlin.
Let us go back to that time in this city.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets and demonstrating for change.
We are in the autumn of 1989 and imagine that all those people who rose up and demanded change had a mobile phone in their pockets.
Who in the Chamber has a mobile phone?
Hold it high.
Keep your mobiles up, keep them up!
Please keep it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
Almost everyone has a mobile phone today.
But today wants to talk about me and my mobile phone and how it changed my life.
And I will talk about the following.
This is 35,830 lines of information.
Raw data.
And why is this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the European Union Commission presented a directive.
This directive is called the Data Retention Directive.
This directive says that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service provider throughout Europe, must store a range of user information.
Who calls whom, who sends an email to whom?
Who sends an SMS to whom?
And when you use a mobile phone where you are.
All this information is stored by your telephone company or your Internet provider for at least six months up to two years.
And people across Europe have stood up and said 'We do not want that'.
You said that we do not want this retention of data.
We want self-determination in the digital age and we do not want the telephone companies and Internet service providers to have to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests who all said: 'We do not want that'.
And here you can see tens of thousands of people coming out onto the streets of Berlin and saying 'freedom, not fear'.
And some even said that this could become Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the secret police force in East Germany.
I also wonder whether this really works.
Can they really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my mobile phone?
So I asked my telephone company, Deutsche Telekom, which was the largest telephone company in Germany at that time, and I asked them, please send me all the information you have stored about me.
I asked her once and asked her again and I did not get a real answer, just empty bla bla.
But then I said to myself, I want to have this information because it is my life that you are recording.
So I decided to take legal action against them because I wanted to have this information.
Deutsche Telekom said no, we will not give you this information.
In the end, a comparison was made with them.
I withdraw the charge, for which they send me all the information they request.
Because in the meantime the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the introduction of the E.U. Directive into German law was unconstitutional.
So I got this ugly brown cover with a CD.
And on the CD was this:
35.830 lines of information.
First I saw it and said to myself, well, it's a huge file, for my own sake.
But then after a while I realized: this is my life.
That is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a bit sceptical, what do I do with it?
Because it shows where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said to myself that I wanted to go out with this information to the public.
I want to make it public.
I want to show people what data retention means.
Together with Zeit Online and Open Data City I did this here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and out, you can scroll forward and backwards.
You can track every step I make.
And you can even see how I travel from Frankfurt to Cologne by train and how many calls I make while I am there.
All of this is possible from this information.
That makes me a little afraid.
But it is not just about me.
It is about us all.
First of all, it is just that I call my wife and she calls me and we talk a couple of times.
And then a few friends call me and they call each other.
And after a while you call you and you call you and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, at what times they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of that.
You can identify the central characters, such as who the group leaders are.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a plan of construction for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect way to monitor a society, because you know who is talking to whom, who is sending an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least 6 months, and up to 2 years in Europe.
As I said at the beginning, imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlin in the autumn of 1989 had mobile phones in their pockets.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the Stasi had known who the leaders were, then perhaps this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And even after that, the fall of the iron curtain did not occur.
Because today government agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get from us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to follow our lives and they want to keep all this for as long as possible.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age are not mutually exclusive.
However, self-determination must be fought today.
They have to fight for this every day.
So when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that it is not old fashioned.
When you go home, tell your fellow Member that just because companies and government agencies have the opportunity to store certain information, they do not have to do so for a long time yet.
And if you do not believe me, ask your telephone company about the information they have stored about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, remember that you will have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spirit shops, fast restaurants, empty areas.
The planners gathered and thought to change the name of South Central to indicate something different, they changed it to South Los Angeles, as if that changed anything that was wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Alcohol shops, fast restaurants, waste land.
Like 26.0 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, home to the drive-thrus and the drive-by.
The funny thing is that the drive-thrus kill more people than the drive-bys.
People are dying in South Central Los Angeles from curable diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is, for example, five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 km away.
I could not see that any more.
And I wondered how you would feel if you did not have access to healthy food, if every time you went out of the house you saw the negative impact of the existing diet system on your neighborhood.
I see wheelchairs being bought and sold like second-hand cars.
I see dialysis centres shooting up like Starbucks.
And I understand that this must stop.
I gathered that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I also had no desire to go on 45 minute round trips to get an apple that was not impregnated with pesticides.
So I planted a food forest in front of my house.
It is a piece of land which we call parkland.
It is 45 to 3 meters.
The thing is that it belongs to the city.
But we must maintain it.
So I think, 'Cool, I can do whatever I want because it is my responsibility and I have to keep it in order'.
And I decided to keep it in place.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Grounds, came together and we started to plant my food forest, and fruit trees, that is, the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of volunteer group, made up of gardeners from all social strata and from the whole city, it is completely voluntary and everything we do is free of charge.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came to me and gave me a practical order and said that I had to remove my garden, the order became a judicial order.
And I thought, "Come already, real?
A judicial order for growing food on a piece of land that you do not care?'
And I thought, "Cool, go ahead with it."
This time it would not work.
The L.A. Times got a splash, Steve Lopez made a story about it, spoke to the City Council and a member of Green Ground, and signed a petition on Change.org and with 900 signatures we were successful.
We held the victory in our hands.
My town council even called and said they support and love what we do.
So, really, why should they not do it?
L.A. has the largest landfill in the United States.
They have 67 km2 of landfill.
These are 20 Central Parks.
That is enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't they find it ok?
When growing one plant you get 1,000 to 10,000 seeds.
Green beans worth one dollar will give you fruit and vegetables worth 75.
It is my message of salvation, I say people to grow their own food.
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there, I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this prefabricated reality created by other people and I fabricate my own reality.
Look, I am an artist.
Gardening is my graffiti.
Just like a graffiti artist who makes walls look beautiful, I make lawn and park areas look beautiful.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of fabric, and the plants and the trees are my decorations for this fabric.
You would be surprised by all the earth's abilities when you use it as a canvas.
You cannot imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I have seen my garden become an instrument for the education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, we must change the composition of the soil.
We are the ground.
You would be amazed at how children are affected.
Gardening is the most therapeutic and daring act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can also buy strawberries.
I remember the time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night, they were in my garden and I came out and they looked so ashamed.
I felt really bad because they were there and I said to them: "You know, you don't have to do it like that.
The garden is not on the street without reason.'
I was ashamed when I saw people who were so close to me and were hungry, and that only encouraged me to do so. People asked me, 'Well, do not worry that people will steal your food'.
And I said, "To hell, no, I'm not afraid they'll take anything.
It is a very useful tool for those who want to get involved in the streets.
That is the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take back their health'.
Another time I built a garden in this homeless home in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me unload the cargo.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it affected them and how they planted with their mother and grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed them, if only for a moment.
Green Grounds has already planted about 20 gardens.
We had 50 people volunteering for our burial actions.
When children grow cabbage, children eat cabbage.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they are not offered anything of this, if they are not shown how food affects the mind and body, they are blind, whatever they are told.
I see young people wanting to work, but they are stuck in this thing – I see coloured children going down the path that is intended for them and not taking them anywhere.
I see gardening as an opportunity where we can train these children to take care of their communities in order to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could produce the next George Washington Carver.
But if we do not change the composition of the soil, we will never do so.
So that is one of my plans, and I want to do it.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take ship containers and turn them into healthy cafés.
So do not misunderstand me.
I am not talking about free fucking, because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability is that it has to be sustained.
I am talking about giving people work, getting children out of the streets and giving them the joy, pride and honour of growing your own food and opening up farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is to make it sexy.
I want us all to become ecological rebels, gangsters, gangster gardeners.
We must turn the picture of Gangstern around.
If you are not a gardener, you are not a gangster.
Gangster you get with 'ner Schaufel, clear?
And let that be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have a meeting where people talk about doing some shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your shovel, into my garden, so we can plant some shit.
Peace, thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "snollygoster".
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And'snollygoster' means 'an dishonest politician'.
Although in the nineteenth century a newspaper editor gave a better definition: "a snobby is someone who aspires to a post, regardless of party, program or doctrine, and achieves his success through the pure power of monumental language hypothesis".
I have no idea what "spracheral" is.
I think something with words.
But it is very important that words are at the heart of politics, and all politicians know that they must try to control language.
Prior to 1771, for example, newspapers were not allowed to publish the exact wording of debates, according to the British Parliament.
This was indeed due to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name Brass Crosby who engaged with Parliament.
They threw him into the Tower of London and imprisoned him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to rebel, and ultimately he had so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later we find the first proof of the phrase "as strong as Brass".
Brass refers to the English word for sheet metal.
But that is not true, it is a case which goes back to a supporter of freedom of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I would like to take you to the United States, at the moment when it has just achieved independence.
The question was asked how to call George Washington, the Head of State.
It was not known.
How do you call the leader of a Republican nation?
This has been debated for an interminable amount of time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of practical proposals.
I think some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, His Holiness George Washington, and again others, protector of the freedom of the people of the United States of America Washington.
Not so memorable.
Some people wanted to call him simply King.
You thought that was tried and tested.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to elect the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was indescribably bored because this debate lasted three weeks.
I read the diary of a senator who keeps writing: 'Still the same subject'.
The reason for the delay and boredom was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives did not want Washington to become greedy for power; they did not want it.
They would probably be able to encourage him to become a king, and might even bring him ideas for his succession.
They wanted to give him the most humiliating, miserable, sorry title they could think of.
This title was 'President'.
President, you did not invent the title; it existed before, but it meant simply that someone presided over an assembly.
Something like chairing a jury.
He had no more size than the name "watcher" or "watcher".
Sometimes there were presidents of small colonial councils and government groups, but it was really an insignificant title.
That is why the Senate rejected it.
You said, 'That is ridiculous, you cannot call him President.
This guy has to sign agreements and meet foreign dignitaries.
Who will take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
Even after three weeks of debate, the Senate did not give in.
Instead, it was agreed to use the title 'President' for the time being, but they wanted to make it absolutely clear that they did not agree with it because of their respect for the opinions and methods of civilised nations, whether in republic or monarchy, where it is customary for the office of the head of state to claim respectable titles – not damned president – and that in dealing with other nations, the dignity of the people of the United States is not jeopardised by the appearance of
There are three interesting lessons to be learned from this.
Firstly – and I think this is the best thing – I have not yet been able to find out whether the Senate has formally confirmed the title of President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has only lent the title; he is only waiting for the Senate to act.
Second, you can learn that when a government says something is temporary – – then it waits 223 years later.
Thirdly, and this is really important, this is the most important point, is that the title 'President of the United States of America' does not sound so humble today, is it not?
This has to do with the little more than 5000 nuclear warheads he has and the world's largest economy and a fleet of drones and all that.
Reality and history have given the title a dimension.
And so the Senate won in the end.
You have been given a respectable title.
And the Senate’s other concern, the appearance of peculiarity – well, that was the case then.
But do you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5000 nuclear warheads etc.
In the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because no one feels humble when told that one is now the President of the United States of America.
And that is the most important thing you can take with you, and I say goodbye to it.
Politicians try to use words to shape reality and control reality, but reality actually changes words much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I arrived in a cargo truck with about 50 rebels fighting for Jalalabad - a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I exchanged my black Converse mids for a pair of brown leather sandals and fired a rocket towards the government soldiers, which I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Long before that, I had grown up with war, but alongside pyjama parties and football games on Saturdays, and fist fights with racist southern children, and religious-nationalist demonstrations chanting "Down with Communism, Long live Afghanistan," and lighting Brezhnev schools before I even knew what that meant.
But that is the geography of the self.
And so I stand here, a native Afghan, a southern prolet of God's mercy, an atheist and a radically politicized artist who has lived, worked and created in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan about which you could make art, but I personally do not like to make rain clouds, I want to make art that confuses personality and challenges authority and reveals hypocrisy, reinterprets reality and even uses a kind of fantasy linguistics to try to understand the world in which we live.
I would like to spend a day in the life of a jihadist who carries out his jihad against communists like "Popstar Bling" and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to earn his living.
And what else can the jihadist do than stand for parliament and campaign with the slogan, "Vote me, I do jihad and I am rich."
And try to use this campaign to uncover these mafiosi who claim to be national heroes.
I want to go into the corruption in Afghanistan with a project called'restitution', where you pretend to be a policeman, set up a false checkpoint on the streets of Kabul and stop cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, you offer them money and apologise on behalf of the Kabul police, and hope that they will accept the 100 Afghanis from us.
I would like to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, the'moderate conflict'.
The war and the foreign views that came with it created a new environment for style and fashion that can only be captured by creating a fashion collection for soldiers and suicide bombers, combining fur from native Afghan foxes with a protective vest, or by fitting several inner pockets into a fashionable neo-traditional vest.
And I would like to see a simple Kabul sliding door between Kipling's 1899 appeal to establish a dialogue that today's development initiatives have their roots in past colonial rhetoric about "The burden of the white man" to protect the brown man from himself and perhaps even civilize him a little.
But all these things can get you into prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be misinterpreted.
But I do it because I must, because the geography of the Self demands it.
That is my burden, but which is your burden?
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Cameron Russell and I have been working as a model for some time.
For 10 years, to be precise.
I have the feeling that an uncomfortable tension is being created in this Chamber, because I should not have worn this dress.
Fortunately I have something to change.
This is the first time someone has changed clothes on the TED stage, so you can be lucky to see it, I think.
If a few women were really frightened when I came out, don't tell me now, I'll check it out on Twitter later.
I also note that I am quite privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
Not everyone has the opportunity to do so.
These heels are very uncomfortable, it is good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the pullover over my head, because then you will all laugh me out, so do nothing as long as it is over my head.
Fine.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, I hope it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
An image is powerful, but an image is also superficial.
I just changed your opinion of me in 6 seconds.
And on this picture – I really never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographer told me to wound my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And, aside from operations or the false tan I took two days ago for work, there are very few ways of changing our appearance, and our appearance – though superficial and unchangeable – has a great impact on our lives.
To be fearless means to be honest today.
And I am on this stage because I am a model.
I am on stage because I am a beautiful white woman and in my industry we call it a sexy girl.
I will now answer the questions people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is: "How do you become a model?"
I always say, 'Oh, I was discovered', but that does not mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a genetic lottery win and an important inheritance and perhaps you wonder what this inheritance consists of.
Well, over the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, which we are biologically programmed to admire, but also as large, slim, feminine, and bright-skinned.
This inheritance was created for me, and it is a inheritance that pays off for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are sceptical at this point, and perhaps some fashion enthusiasts may also say: 'Hold on Naomi, Tyra, Joan Smalls, Liu Wen'.
First of all, I comment on your model knowledge.
But unfortunately I have to tell you that in 2007 a very ambitious NYU PhD student counted all the models on the stage, every single one that was booked and that of the 677 models booked, only 27 or less than four percent were not white.
The next question I'm always asked is: "Can I become a model when I'm an adult?"
First of all, I reply: 'I do not know, it is not my responsibility'.
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is: 'Why?
You can become everything.
You can become the US President, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja heart surgeon poet, which would be totally crazy, because then you would be the first'.
If, after this splendid list, they still say, 'No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model', then I say, 'Become my boss'.
For I have no responsibility for nothing, and you could be the editor of American Vogue, or the director of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
Saying that you want to become a model later is like saying that you want to win the jackpot in the lottery.
You cannot influence it and it is fantastic and it is not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of collected model knowledge, because unlike heart surgeons it can only unfold right now.
If there is a photographer there and the light is exactly there, like a nice beam, and the customer says: "Cameron, we want a photo in the running," well, then the leg goes first, beautiful and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is on three quarters and you simply move forward and back, just like that and then you look back to his imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times.
It looks roughly like this.
Hopefully less funny than the one in the middle.
That was... I do not know what happened.
When you finish school and have a resume and a few jobs, you cannot say much, unfortunately, and when you say you want to be the President of the United States, but the resume says "10 years underwear model," you are viewed as funny.
The next question I often get asked is: "Will all photos be retouched?"
And yes, pretty much all photos are retouched, but that is only a small part of the action.
This is the first photo I took, and it was also the first time I wore a bikini, because I didn’t even have my period at the time.
I know that will now be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
This was how I looked a few months earlier, with my grandmother.
That's me on the day of this shooting.
My girlfriend had to accompany me.
That's me at a pyjama party, a few days before shooting for the French Vogue.
That's me with the football team and in the V magazine.
And that is what I am today.
And I hope you will see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They are constructs and they are constructs of a group of professionals, of hair stylists and make-up artists and photographers and stylists and all their assistants and of pre- and post-production.
Well, next time people ask me, "Do you fight things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20cm heels that I can never wear except just now, but the things I get for free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about that.
I grew up in Cambridge and one day I went to a shop and forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she crossed a red light and of course we were stopped, and it took only one "sorry, Mr Wachtmeister," and we could go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay a high price because of their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and of the 140 000 teenagers who were stopped and felt last year, 85 per cent were black and Latino and mostly young men.
There are only 177 000 young, male black and Latinos living in New York who do not ask themselves the question: 'Have I been stopped?'
'How often will I be stopped? When will I be stopped?'
In my research for this talk, I found that 53% of 13-year-old girls in the US do not like their bodies, and this figure rises to 78% when they reach 17.
The last question I ask is: 'How is it to be a model?'
And I think they expect this answer: 'If you are a bit thinner and have shiny hair, you feel very happy and fabulous'.
And backstage we give an answer that might convey this impression.
We say, 'It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people.'
All of this is true, but it is only half the story, because what we never say in front of the camera, what I never said in front of the camera, is: 'I feel unsafe'.
And I feel unsafe because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever wonder, "Would I be more happy if I had thinner legs and shiny hair?"
Then you should meet some models, because they have the thinnest legs and the most shiny hair and the coolest clothes and they are probably the most unsafe women on the planet because of their appearance.
When I prepared this presentation, it seemed to me very difficult to take an honest assessment, because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable standing here and saying, 'I got all the benefits from a pile of mixed ingredients in my favor', and it also felt very uncomfortable adding, 'and that does not always make me happy'.
It was especially difficult to disclose a legacy of repression on the grounds of gender and race, when I am one of the great beneficiaries of it.
But I am also happy and honoured to be able to stand here, and I think it is great that I have managed to get here before 10 or 20 or 30 years have passed and my career is even more full, because then I would probably not tell you how I got my first job, or perhaps I would not tell you how I paid for college, which is so incredibly important at the moment.
If you take something from this lecture, I hope that we will all recognize the power of image in our supposed successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother, who died in exile: 'Son, resist Gaddafi, fight him.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolutionary."
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan revolution erupted, inspired by the waves of mass revolts in both the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions.
I joined with many other Libyans, inside and outside Libya, in calling for a day of anger and in launching a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
And there it was, a great revolution.
Young Libyan women and men were in the front line, calling for the end of the regime, shouting slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown exemplary courage in standing up to Qaddafi's brutal dictatorship.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the Far East, via the Far West, to the South.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we succeeded in freeing our country and overthrowing the tyrant.
But Qaddafi has left a great burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption, and the basis for change.
For four decades, Qaddafi's tyrannical regime has destroyed both the infrastructure, culture and moral fabric of Libyan society.
Knowing the devastation and the challenges, I, like so many other women, sought to rebuild Libya's civil society, and we called for a co-decided and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation.
Almost 200 organisations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after Qaddafi’s fall, and nearly 300 in Tripoli.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on capacity building, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I established the Libyans' Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders from various fields of life, whose aim is to publicly stand up for the socio-political strengthening of women and for our right to equal participation in the building of democracy and peace.
In the primary elections, I encountered a very difficult environment, an environment that was increasingly polarized, an environment that was characterised by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
I led an initiative by the Libyans' Platform for Peace to achieve a more co-decision-making electoral law, a law that should give every citizen, regardless of background, the right to vote and stand for election and, above all, to establish a vertical and horizontal alternation between male and female candidates for political parties, thereby creating a zip-line list.
In the end, our initiative was taken on board and successfully taken on board.
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
Slowly but surely, the euphoria of the elections and that of the entire revolution receded, as every day we woke up to new news of violence.
One morning we woke up to the news of damage to ancient mosques and Sufi shrines.
Another morning we received news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the embassy.
Another morning, the murders of army officers were reported.
And every day we really wake up under the rule of the militias and their continuing violations of the human rights of prisoners and their disregard for rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, polarized and departed from the ideals and principles — freedom, dignity, social justice — that it initially held.
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [follow-up] to the revolution.
I am not here today to inspire you with the success story of our zip list and the elections.
Rather, I am here today to admit that we, as a nation, have made the wrong choices and the wrong decisions.
We have set our priorities wrongly.
The elections did not bring peace, stability or security to Libya.
Has the zip-line list and the change between female and male candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, it does not.
What then is it?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, both for men and women?
Perhaps women were not the only missing, but rather the female values of compassion, grace and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus formation more urgently than it needed the elections, which in the end only encouraged polarisation and division.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the feminine.
We must stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We must begin to act in the name of compassion and grace.
We must develop a female discourse that not only values but also implements the following values: grace instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya desperately needs in order to achieve peace.
For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the interweaving of feminine and masculine views.
That is the real zip.
We must implement this in our existential capacity before we do it in socio-political terms.
According to a verse from the Koran, "Salam" — peace — "is the word of the merciful God, raheem."
The word "raheem", known in all the Abrahamic traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "rahem" — mother's womb — and symbolizes the maternal feminine that surrounds all mankind, from which the masculine and the feminine, from which all tribes and all peoples have sprung.
And just as the womb completely surrounds the embryo that grows in it, the basic framework of compassion nourishes the whole existence.
That is why we were told: 'My grace includes all things'.
So we were told: 'My grace takes precedence over my grievance'.
May the grace of grace be granted to all of us.
Thank you.
When I was young, I thought my country was the best in the world and I grew up with the song 'Nothing to Envy'.
And I was very proud.
In school, we pondered the story of Kim Il-Sung, but we did not learn very much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea, and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until a changeable moment.
At seven years of age, I saw a public execution for the first time, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I myself never had to suffer hunger.
But in 1995 my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague.
It said: 'If you read this, our five family members will not be in the world because we have not eaten anything for two weeks.
We are lying together on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we will soon die.'
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time about people suffering in my country.
Shortly afterwards I went past the station and saw something dreadful that I cannot erase from my memory.
A lifeless woman lay on the floor, and a malnourished child in her arm looked helplessly at his mother's face.
But no one helped them because everyone was so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a major famine in North Korea.
In the end, more than one million North Koreans were killed by famine, and many more survived only by eating grass, beetle, and bark.
Power failures became more common, so that at night everything around me darkened, except the lights of China on the other side of the shore we lived on.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we did not.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and its neighbors at night.
The largest rivers are the rivers Amrok, which serves as the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very shallow in some places and allows North Koreans to flee.
But many are dying.
Sometimes I saw corpses drifting in the river.
I cannot say much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to distant relatives in China.
I thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take 14 years to live together again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without a family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee, but soon I learned that it was not only extremely difficult, but also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my true identity might leak and I would be sent back to North Korea to face a terrible fate.
One day my greatest nightmare came true when I was captured by the Chinese police and taken to the police station for interrogation.
Someone accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese skills and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and turned down.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answered the questions.
After they had finished the questionnaire, one official said to another: 'It was a misstatement.
She is not a North Korean."
And they let me go, it was a miracle.
Some North Koreans seek asylum in China from foreign embassies, but many are caught and turned down by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they were eventually released because of huge international pressure.
These North Korean women were not so lucky.
Every year, innumerable North Koreans are caught in China and turned away to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed.
Although I was lucky in getting away, many other North Koreans are not.
It is tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identities and struggling hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, their world can be turned upside down in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea and started a new life.
Making my way to South Korea was a greater challenge than I would have thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I also noticed the great difference between North and South Korea.
We are all Koreans, but internally we have developed very apart, because of 67 years of division.
I had an identity crisis.
Is it South Korean or North Korean?
Where do I come from?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although adapting to South Korean life was not easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the entrance exam at university.
Just as I got used to my new life, I received a shocking call.
The North Korean authorities confiscated the money I sent to my family and, as a punishment, my family was forced to move to a remote rural area.
They had to flee as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their flight.
North Koreans have to go an incredible road to freedom.
Ironically, I took a flight back to China and went to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to lead them on more than 2,000 miles through China and then to South-East Asia.
The bus trip lasted one week and we were almost caught several times.
Once when the bus was stopped, a Chinese policeman came in.
He took the cards of everyone and started asking questions.
Since my family did not understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese official spoke to my family, I stood up and told him that they were deaf and I was their supervisor.
He looked suspiciously at me, but fortunately he believed me.
We managed to get to the Laotian border, but I had to use almost all my money to bribe the border controls of Laos.
But even after we crossed the border, my family was imprisoned for crossing the border illegally.
After paying fines and bribes, my family was released within a month, but shortly afterwards my family was re-arrested in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the great setbacks of my life.
I had done everything to help my family to freedom and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went between the immigration authorities and the police station and tried desperately to free my family, but I did not have enough money to pay bribes or fines again.
I lost all my hope.
Then the voice of a man asked me, 'What is going on?'
I was quite surprised that a stranger was taking care of it.
In broken English and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and he went to a bank and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of prison.
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart and asked him, 'Why do you help me?'
"I am not helping you," he replied.
'I help the North Korean people'.
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The friendly stranger symbolized for me a new hope that North Koreans so badly needed, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the ray of hope that North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea, but to gain freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and, once they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning English, vocational training and much more.
We can also be the bridge between the people of North Korea and the outside world, because many of us remain in contact with family members, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so fortunate to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I wanted to help hopeful North Koreans succeed, with international support.
I am sure you will see many more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have just one request today.
Please do not tell me that I am normal.
I would now like to introduce my brothers.
Remi is 22, tall and very good looking.
He cannot speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
It shares them unconditionally and it shares them uncompromisingly.
He is not greedy, he does not pay attention to the colour of the skin.
He does not care about religious differences and imagine: he has never told a lie.
When he sings songs from our childhood, tries words that I do not even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16 years old, tall and very good-looking.
He has an absolutely infallible memory.
But it also has a selective one.
He can’t remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release of every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, while playing the very first episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga’s birthday.
Do they not sound incredible?
But many people do not agree.
Indeed, because their minds do not fit into the social version of normal, they are often ignored and misunderstood.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that, although this was the case, although they were not considered ordinary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary – autistic and extraordinary.
Well, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "autism", it is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It is expressed differently by each individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And a new person worldwide is diagnosed with autism every 20 minutes, and although it is one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or cure.
And I cannot remember the first time I encountered autism, but I cannot remember a day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life.
And after a few months I realized that he was different.
He shouted a lot.
He didn’t want to play like the other babies did, and in fact he didn’t seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ruled in his own world, with his own rules, and he enjoyed the smallest things, such as standing cars in rows in the room, looking at the washing machine and eating everything he could.
And as he grew older, he became different and the differences became more visible.
But behind the rages and frustration and never-ending hyperactivity there was something truly unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a man who had never lied.
It is extraordinary.
Well, I cannot deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments when I wish they were just like me.
But I go back with the thoughts to the things they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I would not want to exchange for normality.
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different does not mean that any of us is wrong.
It simply means that there is another kind of right.
And if I could say just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be exceptional.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have – we have a gift!
The chance of greatness, progress and change dies when we try to be like someone else.
Please – do not tell me that I am normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with awe and curiosity with this photo where a projectile drills an apple and with an exposure time of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we are one million times faster and we see the world not with a million or a billion images per second, but with a trillion images per second.
I am introducing a new type of photography, Femto photography, a new shooting technique that is so fast that it can take time lapse shots of light in motion.
And with this we can build cameras that can look around the corners of our sight or look inside our body without a X-ray image and really question what we mean by a camera.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in a billionth of a second – that is, several femtoseconds – I create a packet of photons that is barely a millimetre wide and this photon package, this projectile, will move at lightning speed, and – as I said – a million times faster than a normal projectile.
So if you take this projectile, this photon package and shoot it into this bottle, how will these photons break in the bottle?
What does light in slow motion look like?
So, all this event –
So, remember, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond – that is how long the light takes to travel that distance – but I slow down this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca Cola did not finance this research.
So, there is a lot of things happening in this movie, so let me analyze it and show you what is happening.
The pulse, our projectile, enters the bottle with a photon package that starts to move through and finally breaks inside.
Some of the light reaches the table and you see the waves spreading out.
Many of the photons ultimately reach the bottle closure and explode in various directions.
As you can see, there is an air bubble floating around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table and because of the reflections from above, you see that the reflections at the end of the bottle are focused after some pictures.
If you take a normal projectile and let it go the same way and slow down the video by 10 billion, do you know how long you will have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie – – of a slow, normal projectile in motion.
And what about some still life photography?
You can see these waves splashing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the background.
It is like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me that nature would paint a photo like this, each a femto picture, but of course our eye sees a composite single picture.
But if you look at this tomato again, you will see that when the light splashes over the tomato, it remains lit, it does not get dark.
Why is this so? Because the tomato is ripe and the light splashes around it and comes out after a few billionth of seconds.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is built into your camera phone, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and see if a fruit is ripe without touching it at all.
So how did my MIT team build this camera?
So as a photographer you know that when you take a photo with a short exposure time, you have very little light, but we expose one billion times faster than your shortest exposure time, so you get almost no light.
So we do the following: we send this projectile, this photon package, millions of times and record it again and again with very clever synchronization and we combine these gigabytes of data in a computer to create the Femto videos I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future Superman: being able to see around corners?
The idea is to shine some light on the door.
It will bounce, go into the room, some of it will reflect back to the door and finally back to the camera and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.
And that is not science fiction; we have already built it.
On the left you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a doll hidden and we will let the light shine on the door.
After our paper was published in Nature Communications, Nature.com highlighted it and they created this animation.
We will fire these light projectiles and they will hit this wall and this photon package will be spread in all directions and some of the photons will reach our hidden doll, which will break the light, and then the door will reflect some of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time.
And because we have a camera that is so fast – our Femto camera has some unique capabilities.
It has a very good time resolution and it can see the world at lightning speed.
And that means we know the distance to the door, but also the distance to the hidden objects, but we do not know which point belongs to which distance.
By turning a laser, we can take a raw image that doesn’t make sense – as you see on the screen – but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and then put them together and try to analyze the different light bounces, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We still have a lot to do before we can put this into practice from the laboratory, we could build cars that avoid collisions and see what is behind the curve, or we could use them to look for survivors in dangerous situations by looking at light reflected through open windows, or we could build endoscopes that look deep into the body around Okkluder, and also cardioscopes.
But because of blood and tissue, this is of course very challenging, which is why it is a real wake-up call for scientists to think about Femto photography now, as a new imaging technique could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as with Doc Edgerton, himself a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-fast photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we collect every time, are not just using scientific image processing, but we can also create a new form of computer photography, with time lapses and color encodings, and we can look at these waves, remember, the time between each of these waves is only a few trillionths of seconds.
But something funny happens here too.
If you look at these waves under the bottle lid, you will see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What is happening here?
It turned out that because we are shooting at almost lightning speed, we have strange effects and Einstein would have loved to have seen this picture.
The order in which events in the world happen appear in the camera in the opposite order, so by applying the corresponding relationship of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
So whether for corner photography or creating a new imaging process for medicine or new forms of representation, since our invention we have made all data and details openly available on our website and hope that the "self-makers", the creatives and the research community will show us that we should stop fixing ourselves on the Megapixels in cameras – – and start focusing on the next dimension of representation.
It is about time, thank you.
There are many ways in which our fellow human beings can improve our lives.
We do not meet every neighbour on the street, so many wisdoms are not passed on, but we use the same public places.
In the last years I have tried to share more with my neighbors using things like stickers, stencils and chalk.
The projects arose from my questions, how, how much rent my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without disturbing each other?
How can we share our memories of abandoned buildings and better understand the landscapes?
And how can we share our hopes for empty homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
The huge oaks that have shadowed lovers, drunkards and dreamers for hundreds of years, calm my soul.
I believe that every time someone sneezes, there is a parade in New Orleans.
This city has some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it is also the city with the most abandoned land in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how to make it more beautiful, and I thought about something that has changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone I loved very much.
She was a mother to me and her death came suddenly and unexpectedly.
I thought a lot about death and I felt a great gratitude for my life and it brought me clarity about the things that are important to me now in life.
But it is difficult for me to maintain this view every day.
It is easy to get lost in everyday life and forget what is really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed one side of the abandoned house into a huge table and wrote with a stencil the gaping sentence: "Before I die, I want..." Anyone who comes by can take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public place.
I was not sure what I could expect from the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled and it grew further and further.
I would like to share with you some sentences written by the people on the wall.
'Before I die, I want to be charged with piracy'.
'Before I die, I want to stand broad-legged above the International Date Line'.
'Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people'.
'Before I die, I want to plant a tree'.
"Before I die, I want to live "net independently."
'Before I die, I want to hold it in my arms again'.
"Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."
"Before I die, I want to be entirely myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people made me laugh, cry and comfort me during the hard times.
It is about knowing that you are not alone.
It is about understanding our neighbours in a new and insightful way.
It is about making room for reflection and reflection and remembering what is most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year and received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I created a brickwork and walls have been erected worldwide in countries like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and others.
We have shown how much power our public places have when we have the opportunity to speak out and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relations with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it is more important than ever to look at things with the right eye and to remember that life is short and sensitive.
We are often prevented from talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I have realised that preparing for death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The thought of death makes life clear to us.
Our common places show best what is important to us as individuals and as communities, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, fears, and stories, the people around us can not only help us to create better places, but they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I am concerned with applied mathematics, and one particular problem for anyone who is concerned with applied mathematics is that we are like corporate consultants.
No one knows what we are doing.
Therefore, today I will dare to explain to you what I am doing.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We are thrilled to see masterful ballet and step dances, as you will see in a moment.
Ballet requires an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skills, and possibly a basic aptitude that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying this extraordinary ability, as is the case with my acquaintance Jan Stripling, who was a ballet virtuoso at the time.
Over the years, a great deal of progress has been made in treatment.
Nevertheless, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who suffer from this disease and who have to live with the incurable symptoms of weakness, tremors, stiffness and others that this disease causes, and we therefore need objective means to detect the disease before it is too late.
We must be able to measure progress objectively and, ultimately, the only way to really know whether there is healing is if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
The most annoying thing is that Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders do not have biomarkers, so you cannot perform a simple blood analysis.
It is very expensive and therefore never does it outside clinical studies.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
This would save a tedious trip to hospital, and what if patients could do the test themselves?
There would be no need for expensive hospital staff.
It costs about $300 to be examined in the neurological department.
I would therefore like to propose to you an unconventional method of trying to achieve this, because we are all virtuosi, in a sense at least, like my friend Jan Stripling.
Here you can see a video of the vibrating voice lips.
We can consider ourselves as a vocal ballet dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we produce sounds, and we all have the genes for it.
And like ballet it requires a lot of exercise.
Remember how long a child takes to learn to speak.
Through the sound we can determine the position of the vibrating voice lip and, like the limbs, the voice organs are also affected by Parkinson's disease.
The lower recording shows an example of irregular lip tissue.
We are always seeing the same symptoms.
Voice tremors, weakness, stiffness.
The language becomes even quieter and haunted over time, and that is an example of this.
These effects on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision voice analysis software, combined with the latest machine learning, which is now very advanced, we can now determine exactly where someone is in a range between illness and health, just because of the voice noise.
How can these tests compare with clinical tests? Well, they are both non-invasive.
neither does the infrastructure.
No new clinics need to be built for this.
And both are accurate, so the votes are not tested by experts.
They can therefore be carried out independently.
They are very fast, they last a maximum of 30 seconds.
They are very cheap and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, it can be used on a large scale.
These astonishing goals can now be achieved:
We can reduce logistical difficulties for patients.
Patients do not need to have routine checks carried out in the clinic.
We can obtain objective data by frequent observation.
We can carry out a low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and make it possible for the first time to carry out an entire population investigation.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease for the first time before it is too late.
Today we are taking the first step in this direction, we are launching the Parkinson's voice initiative.
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe we want to record a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough starting data to achieve these goals.
We have telephone numbers which are accessible to three quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, Parkinson's or Parkinson's, can call for a few cents to leave a picture, and I am pleased to announce that we have already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, 10,000 people, can you tell who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happened was that the patient had to tell during the call whether or not this person was suffering from Parkinson's disease.
Some may not manage to do it to the end.
But we are collecting a huge database under various circumstances, which is interesting, because we are in the process of sorting it out to see what the real markers of Parkinson's disease are.
At the moment, do you have 86 percent accuracy?
It is much better.
My student Thanasis – I must praise him for doing such fantastic work – has now shown that it also works via the mobile network, which makes this project possible, and we are at 99 per cent accuracy.
I would call that an improvement.
This means that people can – people can call with their mobile phones and do the test, people with Parkinson’s could call, have their voice recorded so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much, Mr Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background you see my father's cows and behind the cows is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only partially fenced in the south, which means that wildlife such as zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them and then they do this here.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows, which was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and found her dead, it was terrible, it was our only bull.
My tribe, the Massai tribe, believes that we came from heaven together with our animals and pastureland, which is why our animals mean so much to us.
As a child I learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are Morans, they protect our tribe and our herds, and they are also concerned about this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here is one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I believe that this is why there are so few lions left in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy aged between six and nine is responsible for his father's cows, and so was mine.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire, because lions are afraid of fire.
But then I realised that this would not really help us, but rather help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn’t give up, I continued.
I had a second idea, I tried it with a bird’s eye view.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cowshed.
But lions are very wise animals.
They come, see the birds and go back, but the next time they come and say that the thing is not moving at all, that it is still here.
And they attack and kill our cattle.
One night I watched the barn, I ran around it with a torch in my hand and the lions didn't attack.
Lions are afraid of light moving.
I had an idea.
As a young boy, I worked all day in my room and once even dismantled my mother’s new radio, which almost killed me the day before, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a directional indicator from a motorcycle, which shows whether you want to turn right or left, and it blinkes.
And I got a switch to turn on and off the lights.
This is a small pear from a broken flashlight.
And then I put it together.
The solar panel charges the battery, the battery supplies electricity to the directional display, which I call a transformer.
And the directional indicators are flashing.
You see the pears pointing outward, because that is where the lions come from.
And that is how it looks for the lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and the lions believe I am going around the stable, while I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed it at home and since then we have had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbours heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals to lions and she asked me if I could install the lights for her.
And I said 'yes'.
I installed the lights, you can see the lions in the background.
Since then I have supplied the lights to seven houses in the neighborhood and they worked really well.
My idea is now being used throughout Kenya, also for other predators like hyenas or leopards, and also to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me win a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I am really excited.
My new school is involved and helps by donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and together we install the lights where there are no lights yet and I show people how to use them.
A year ago I was just a boy from the savannah, looking after his father's cows, and I saw planes flying over me and said to myself, 'One day I'll sit in one!'
And here I am.
I was allowed to arrive by plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I grow up, I want to become an aeronautical engineer and pilot, which is my great dream.
I used to hate lions, but my invention allows me to save my father's cows and the lions, and we can live side by side with the lions without a dispute.
In my language, that means: thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you now have this scholarship.
You are working on other electrical inventions.
What is the next on the list?
My next invention, well, I am working on an electric fence.
Yes, I know that electric fences have long been invented, but I want to have my own.
You tried it once, didn't you? Yes, I tried it once, but I gave up again because I got a slap.
Richard Turere, you are something very special.
We will support you in every step of your way, my friend.
Thank you very much.
Since I am old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography has been my passion, but today I would like to share with you 15 of my favourite pictures; and not one of them I have done.
The lighting was not even considered.
To be honest, most of them were shot by tourists who happened to pass by.
My story begins when I was in New York for a lecture and my wife made this picture of my daughter on her first birthday on my arm.
Exactly one year later we were back in New York and so we decided to take the same picture again.
Well, you can see what that means...
As my daughter's third birthday approached, my wife said, 'Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do it a father-daughter trip to continue the ritual?'
We started to ask tourists who were passing by to take a picture of us.
You know, it is remarkable how universal the gesture is when you hand over your camera to a completely stranger.
No one ever said no and fortunately no one has ever disturbed our camera.
At that time we did not know how much these journeys would change our lives.
This trip has become very sacred to us.
This was recorded here only weeks after 11 September and I had to explain what happened on that day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a fixed moment, or a certain journey.
They are also an opportunity for us to spend a week in October to stop the time and reflect on our time and how we change from year to year, not only physically but in everything.
While we always take the same picture, our perspective changes from time to time.
This very intense time we spend together is something we appreciate and look forward to every year.
Lastly, during one of our trips, we walked and suddenly she stood like a wurst, pointing to a red awning at a doll shop that she had learned to love as a little child, during previous trips.
And she told me about the feelings she felt as a five-year-old in this place.
She said that she remembers when she first saw the shop nine years ago how her heart jumped.
She is now looking for universities in New York because she really wants to study in New York.
And I suddenly realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And therefore I would like to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I do not know how it looks for you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I am hardly on a family photo.
I am always the one who makes the picture.
I would like to encourage each of you today to come into the picture and do not hesitate to ask anyone: 'Do you want to make a picture of us?'
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy patient.
I was a PhD student and studied Clinical Psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
When Alex came to the first session, she was wearing jeans and a foul top, fell on the sofa in my office, shoved her sandals off and told me she was going to talk about men’s problems.
And when I heard that, I was relieved.
My fellow student was the first patient to be taken by a arsonist.
And I got a woman in the 20s who wanted to talk about guys.
I thought I could get away with that.
But I didn't get it.
With the funny stories Alex brought into the meeting, it was easy for me to simply nod with my head as we pushed the problems ahead.
"30 is the new 20", said Alex and as far as I could guess she was right.
Work came later, marriage came later, children came later, even death came later.
People in the 20s like Alex and I had nothing but time.
But soon my supervisor urged me to question Alex's love life.
I voted against.
I said, 'Yes, clearly, she meets men below her level, she sleeps with a weak head, but she will not marry him'.
And then my supervisor said: "Not yet, but perhaps she marries the next.
Also, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she is married."
That is what psychologists call an aah-moment.
That was the moment when I realised that 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people settle in their homes later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a development failure.
This made Alex's 20s the optimal development time and we sat there and wasted it.
I realized that this kind of harmless neglect was a serious problem with real consequences, not only for Alex and her love life, but for the careers, families and prospects of all people in the 20s.
At that time, there are 50 million people in the United States in the 1920s.
We are talking about about 15% of the population, or 100%, when you consider that no one reaches adulthood without going through the age of 20.
Please register if you are in your 20s.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah, you are all incredible.
If you work with someone in the 20s, love one, lose sleep because of one in the 20s, I want to see you... OK, great people in the 20s are really important.
My specialty is people in the 20s, because I believe that every one of these 50 million should know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists have long known: the challenge of the 20s is one of the simplest yet most moving things you can do for work, love, happiness, perhaps even for the world.
That is not my opinion; these are facts.
We know that 80% of the most formative moments happen during the period up to 35.
This means that 8 out of 10 decisions, experiences and aha experiences that make your life what it is until you are in the middle of 30 have already happened.
Do not panic if you are over 40.
I believe that this group will be well off.
We know that the first 10 years of a profession have an exponential impact on how much money you will earn.
We know that at the age of 30, more than half of Americans are married or live with or have a relationship with their future partner.
We know that the brain is going through its second and last great growth in the 20s and is getting wired for adulthood, which means that whatever you want to change in you, now is the time to do it.
We know that personality changes more often during the 20s than at any other time in life, and that women's fertility reaches its peak at the age of 28, and that things get complicated after 35.
In the 20s, you should be further training about your body and your possibilities.
When we think about the development of a child, we all know that the first 5 years are crucial for language learning and binding in the brain.
It is the time when ordinary, everyday life has an excessive influence on the future.
But we hear little about the fact that there is such a thing as adult development and that our 20s are a crucial time for it.
But people in the 20s didn't get to hear that.
The press is talking about the time shift in adulthood.
Scientists call the 20s a prolonged puberty.
Journalists think of stupid nicknames for people in the 20s like "Twixters" or "Kidults".
That is true.
As a culture, we have trivialised what is now the crucial decade for adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that great things can be achieved with a plan and a little too little time.
Is that not true?
So what happens when you shave your head in the 20s and say, "You get 10 years extra to make something out of your life"?
Nothing at all.
This man has been robbed of ambition and urgency and nothing is happening.
And so every day, intelligent, interesting people in the 20s like you or your sons and daughters come to my office and say something like: 'I know my boyfriend doesn't do me well, but this relationship doesn't count, just kill the time.'
Or they say: 'Everyone says that as long as I have managed to start my career at the age of 30, everything is fine'.
But later it sounds like: "My 20s are almost over and I have nothing to show.
I had a better resume when I finished university."
And then it sounds like: "In my 20s, finding a partner was like going to Jerusalem.
Everyone was walking around and having fun, but then at the age of 30 the music suddenly stopped and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who stood still, I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the next chair in my 30s'.
Where are the people in the 20s here?
Do not do so.
Well, that is easy to say, but it does not make a mistake, because there is a great deal at stake.
When much has been transferred to the 30s, there is a huge pressure to start a career quickly in the 30s, choose a city, have a partner and two or three children in a much shorter time span.
Many of these things are incompatible and as research now shows simply more laborious and stressful all at once in the 30s.
The post-Millennium Midlife Crisis does not mean buying a red sports car.
It means that you cannot do the career you want to do.
To remember that you cannot have this child you want, or you cannot give the child siblings.
Too many people in the 30s and 40s look at themselves and at me and say about their 20s: "What did I do?
I want to change what people do and think in the 20s.
This is a story that shows how it can happen.
It is the story of Emma.
Emma came to my office when she was 25, because she had, as she put it, an identity crisis.
She said she would like to work in the art or entertainment sector, but she had not yet decided, so she would have been serving in the past years.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with her boyfriend, who allowed his temper to prevail over his ambitions.
And, while her 20s were hard, her years before were much worse.
She often cried in the meetings, but then she gathered and said, 'You cannot choose your family, but your friends'.
One day Emma came very struck and wept for almost the whole hour.
She had bought a directory and spent the whole morning entering her many contacts, but then she stood on the blank spot after the words: "In case of an emergency, please notify...".
She was almost hysterical when she looked at me and said, 'Who will be there for me if I have a car accident?
Who will care for me if I have cancer?"
At that moment I had to pull myself together not to say 'I'.
But Emma didn’t need a therapist who really cared about her.
Emma needed a better life and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned too much since my first patient Alex to just watch Emma’s crucial decade dissolve into pleasure.
In the next few weeks and months I gave Emma three advices that every 20-year-old, whether man or woman, should hear.
First, I told Emma that she did not have an identity crisis, but rather that she was supposed to acquire identity capital.
I meant that it should look for something that would help it.
Make something that is an investment for you, invest in something that you want to be next.
I didn’t know about Emma’s career, and no one knows what the future of work looks like, but I know that identity capital generates identity capital.
Now is the time for this international job, this internship, this startup you wanted to try.
I am not going to detract from the voyages of discovery of the 20s, but I am going to detract from those that do not count, which are not journeys of discovery at all.
That is procastration.
I said to Emma: explore the world of work, but do something about it.
Secondly, I said: urban society is overvalued.
Good friends are fine to get to the airport, but 20s stacked up with people who think like them border on whom they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work.
This new thing, this new person to settle for a deal, usually comes from outside of one's own environment.
New things come from so-called "weak alliances", that is, from friends of friends of friends.
It is true: half of the 20s are underemployed or not employed at all.
But the other half is not, and weak alliances have brought them there.
Half of the jobs have never been advertised, so if you contact the boss of your neighbour, you will get a job that isn't advertised.
This is not fraud, it is the way information is being disseminated.
The last advice: Emma thought that you cannot choose the family, but the friends.
This was true for her when she grew up, but as she was in the twenty-first century, she would soon choose her own family if she chose a partner and started a family.
I told her that the time to choose a new family was now.
You may think that it is better to settle at 30 than at 20 or 25, and I agree with you.
But having somebody you sleep or live with in your life when everyone marries on Facebook is no progress.
The best time to plan your marriage is before you have one, which means being as determined in love as you are in finding work.
Choosing your family means choosing consciously whom and what you want, not because it works, or because you are spending time with someone who has just chosen you.
So what happened to Emma?
We went through her address book and she found the co-worker of a cousin who worked in a museum in another state.
This weak band helped her get a job there.
This offer of work gave her the reason to leave her boyfriend with whom she lived.
Now, five years later, she is a planner of events for museums.
She married a man she chose deliberately.
She loves her new career and her new family and she sends me a card which said: 'Now the line 'in case of emergency contact' is not big enough'.
Emma’s story sounds like everything is easy, but that’s what I love about 20-year olds.
It is so easy to help them.
20-year-olds are like ready-to-go aircraft leaving the airport and heading west somewhere.
Just after the start, a small change of course can make a difference whether you land in Alaska or Fiji.
This applies to twenty-one, twenty-five or twenty-nine years of age, a good conversation, a great holiday, an inspiring TEDTalk can have a huge impact for years to come and even for generations to come.
This is an idea that should reach all 20s you know.
It is as simple as what I said to Alex.
I have the privilege of telling these 20s, like Emma, every day: the 30s are not the new 20s, so get up, get identity capital, use your weak bonds, choose your family yourself.
Do not define yourself by what ye do not know or have not done.
You are making your own decisions about your life right now.
Thank you.
Throughout computer history, our goal has always been to reduce the distance between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can exercise our imagination.
And that distance has become smaller, smaller and smaller, and now it is less than a millimetre, the thickness of a touch screen, and computers have become accessible to everyone.
But I wondered how it would be if there were no border at all.
I imagined what that would look like.
First of all I developed this tool that penetrates the digital world, so if you push the screen strongly it transforms the physical figure into pixels.
Designers can then materialize their ideas directly in 3D and surgeons can practice on virtual organs under the screen.
This tool has therefore broken the boundary.
But our hands are still outside the screen.
How can we intervene, interact with digital information, using all the skill of our hands?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences, together with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and transformed a small space above the keyboard into a digital workstation.
By combining a transparent screen and deep-cameras for finger and face detection, you can now lift your hands from the keyboard, move into the 3D space and touch pixels with your naked hands.
Since windows and files have a position in the actual space, you can select them as easily as you pick a book from a shelf.
Then you can scroll through the book and mark lines and words on the virtual touchpad below each window.
Architect can stretch and rotate their models directly with their two hands.
In these two examples, we are therefore entering the digital world.
But how about turning the whole thing around and getting digital information to reach us instead?
Many of you have already experienced buying articles online and returning them later.
But now you do not have to worry about that any more.
Here I have an "Online-Augmented-Badge".
This visibility is obtained by means of a display attached to the head or transparent when the system understands the geometry of our body.
Expanding this idea, I began to think about making the pixels not only visible in space, but also physical, so that we can touch and feel them.
What would such a future look like?
In the MIT Media Lab, together with my consultant Hirishi Ishii and my employee Rehmi Post, I created a real pixel.
Well, in this case, this round magnet behaves like a three-dimensional pixel in our world, meaning that both computers and humans can move this object anywhere – at least within this small 3D space.
In effect, we have switched gravity off and control movement by combining magnetic levitation, mechanical drive and these capture technologies.
By programming the object digitally, we free it from the restrictions of space and time, which means human movements can now be recorded, reproduced and kept permanently in the real world.
For example, choreography can be taught over long distances or Michael Jordan’s famous jump can be imitated time and again in the real world.
Students can use this to learn complex concepts such as planet movement and physics, and unlike computer screens or textbooks, it is a real and tangible experience that you can touch and feel, and it is very powerful.
Even more exciting than just materializing what we currently have in the computer, is to imagine how programming the world will change even our daily activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show us something, but will begin to interact directly with us as part of our physical environment, without separating us from our real world.
Today we started by talking about borders, but when we remove that border, the only border is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained for two years to become a gymnast, in Hunan, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in first class, the government wanted to send me to a school for athletes, all the costs paid.
But my mother said 'no'.
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that the only way to happiness was a safe and well-paid job.
It doesn't matter whether I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That is me as I play on my imaginary piano.
A singer must start acrobatics training very early, so I tried everything to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the school director and the radio show moderator.
But the adults didn't like my idea.
The adults didn't think I was serious about it.
Only my friends supported me, but they were just children, as powerless as I myself.
And at the age of 15 I knew I was too old to start training.
So my dream would never come true.
I was afraid that I could only hope for a second chance for the rest of my life.
But that is so unfair.
So I had set my mind to find another vocation.
Nobody here to teach me anything?
So I turned to books.
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice with this book about a family of writers and musicians. ["Briefe der Familie von Fu Lei"] I found my model in an independent woman, while the Confucian tradition requires obedience. ["Jane Eyre"] From this book I learned to be efficient. ["Im Dutzend billiger"] Books inspired me to study abroad.
[Samao's Complete Work] [The Lessons of History by Nan Huaijin] In 1995 I came to the USA and which books did I first read?
Of course books that are prohibited in China.
"The Good Earth" is about the life of Chinese farmers.
That is simply not a propaganda tool, have I understood?
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
But that is a subject for another time.
But the fifth commandment brought me some kind of enlightenment: 'You shall honor thy father and thy mother.'
"Honor," I thought, "is so different and much better than obedience."
That was my way to free myself from Confucian guilt and renew my relationship with my parents.
Through the encounter with a new culture I started with comparative reading.
This gives us a lot of insight.
For example, I did not find this card in the right order at first, because Chinese students are growing up with it.
It never came to my mind that China did not need to be at the centre of the world.
A map therefore tells something about the personal view.
Comparative reading is actually nothing new.
In the academic world, it is a standard procedure.
There are even research areas such as Comparative Religion and Comparative Literature.
Comparison and contrast allow a more complex understanding of a subject.
So I thought, if comparative reading works in research, why not in everyday life?
So I started to read two books at once.
They can act from people – ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson] ["John Adams" by David McCullough] who were involved in the same event, or from friends with common experiences.
I also compare the same stories in different genres – [King James Bible] [The Bible after Biff] by Christopher Moore – or similar stories from different cultures, as in Joseph Campbell's wonderful book ["Lively Myth" by Joseph Campbell] Christ and Buddha, for example, had to resist three temptations.
In Christ, the temptations were economic, political, and spiritual.
In Buddha’s case, they were all psychological: lust, fear, and social duty – interesting.
If you know a foreign language, it is also fun to read your favourite books in two languages.
["Symphony for a Seabird" by Thomas Merton] ["The Run of Water – The Wisdom of Taoism" by Alan Watts] Instead of losing my time in the translation, I found out how much I can gain from it.
I have learned, for example, from translation that "happiness" literally translates "quick joy".
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother".
Books are for me like a magic gate, through which I connect with the people of the past and the present.
I know I will never feel lonely or powerless.
A broken dream is really nothing compared to what many others have experienced.
I have come to the conclusion that it is not the only purpose of a dream to become a reality.
Its main purpose is to bring us into touch with where dreams come from, where our passion and our happiness come from.
Even a broken dream can fulfil this purpose.
Because of books I am here today, happy, back with a purpose in life and with a clear view, most of the time over.
May books always be with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came into the class and she was as impressive as new girls always seem to be.
She had long shiny hair and a small cute pen, was good at geography and spelling.
In that school year, I was asleep with jealousy until I developed a devilish plan.
So one day I stayed in school for a little longer, much longer, and kept myself hidden in the girl's toilet.
When the air was clean, I came out, entered the classroom and took the notebook from the teacher's desk.
And then I did it.
I manipulated the notes of my rival, just a little, just a few ones.
All the one.
When I went back to the book, I noticed that some of my other classmates had quite good marks.
So I corrected all the notes in the jealousy rush, without any imagination.
I gave them four and I gave myself one, because I was there all the time.
I am still astonished at my behaviour.
I do not understand where the idea came from.
I do not understand why I felt so good about it.
I felt really good.
Nor do I understand why I was never punished for this.
It was so obvious.
I was never caught.
But most of all I am amazed: Why was it so disturbing that this little girl was so good at spelling?
I am amazed by jealousy.
It is so mysterious, so profound.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
They are very susceptible by nature to these diseases.
We know that jealousy is the main cause of murder among husbands in the USA.
But I have never read a study that could explain their solitude, their longevity, or their macabre thrill.
To do this, we must turn to literature, because the novel is the laboratory in which jealousy in all its possible forms has been analysed.
Is it an exaggeration to say that if we did not have jealousy, we would not have literature?
So no unfaithful Helena, no "Odyssey".
No jealous king, no "adventure of 1001 Nights".
No Shakespeare.
The reading lists of the US schools are moving away, because we lose: "Schall und Wahn", the great "Gatsby", "Fiesta", "Madame Bovary", "Anna Karenina".
No jealousy, no Proust, I know it has become fashionable to say that Proust has the answer to everything, but in relation to jealousy he really does.
This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of his masterpiece "In the Search for the Wasted Time" and his thorough analysis of sexual jealousy and normal competition, my thing that we can have hope.
Think of Proust, think of feelings.
We think of the little boy who is trying to sleep.
We think of a piece of cake, immersed in lavender tea.
We forget how harsh his vision was.
We forget how merciless he is.
For Virginia Woolf, these kinds of books are as tough as cat's cradle.
I do not know how the cat's belly is, but let us say it is impressive.
Let us see why the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust fit so well together.
Is it so obvious that jealousy, reduced to person-desire-barrier, is such a solid basis for a history?
I do not know, but I think it is simply a very tight boundary, because think of what happens when we are jealous.
When we are jealous, we tell each other a story.
tell us stories about the lives of other people and they make us feel bad because they are designed to feel bad.
As narrative writers and audiences, we know what details it needs to include in order to punch the knife into the rib, is it?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and Proust was familiar with this.
In the first volume, "In Swann's World", in the novel series, Swann, one of the protagonists, thinks very lovingly about his lover and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences – Proust's sentences, they are as long as rivers – he looks up and realizes: "Wait, all I love about this woman would someone else love about this woman.
Whatever she gives me and what makes me happy could also make someone else happy, perhaps even at this moment'.
This is the story he tells himself, and from then on Proust writes that Swann adds every new stimulus he discovers in his beloved to his "arsenal of instruments in his private torture chamber".
We have to admit that Swann and Proust are notoriously jealous.
Proust's friends would have had to leave the country if they had wanted to stop him.
But you don't have to be jealous to admit that it's hard work, isn't it?
Jealousy is tiring.
It is a hungry feeling that must be nourished.
What does jealousy like?
Enthusiasm likes information.
Enthusiasm likes details.
Jealousy likes long shiny hair and small cute pencils.
Jealousy likes photos.
That’s why Twitter is so successful.
In fact, Proust combines the language of science and jealousy.
When Swann experiences this enthusiasm, suddenly listens to the door and attacks his lover's servants, he defends this behavior.
He says: 'You may think that it is repulsive, but it is nothing else to interpret an ancient text or look at a monument.'
He says: 'There are scientific studies with real intellectual value'.
Proust tries to show us that jealousy is intolerable and makes us look stupid, but at its core it is a search for knowledge, for the truth, the painful truth, and as far as Proust is concerned: the painful the better.
Sorrow, humiliation, loss – this is Proust’s path to wisdom.
He says: 'A woman we need, who makes us suffer, conjures up a greater and broader spectrum of feelings than the genius of a man who interests us'.
Is it telling us that we should look for cruel women?
No, I think he is trying to tell us that jealousy tells us something about ourselves.
Is there any other feeling that opens us in this particular way?
Does any other feeling reveal our aggression, our hidden ambition, and our claim?
Does any other feeling teach us to look at it with such strange intensity?
Freud should write about it later.
One day Freud was visited by a very anxious young man who was consumed by the thought that his wife was cheating him.
And Freud says: this man is somehow strange because he doesn’t even look at what his wife does.
Because she is innocent, and everyone knows that.
The poor creature is under suspicion for no good reason.
Instead, he looks for things his wife does without notice, i.e. unintentional behavior.
Does she smile too much or does she happen to meet a man?
[Freud] says that the man becomes the guardian of his wife's subconscious.
The novel is very good on this point.
The novel describes very well how jealousy intensively trains us, however, not look closely.
The more jealous we are, the more we are drawn to fantasy.
Therefore, I think that jealousy does not lead us to do violent or illegal things.
Jealousy leads us to become very inventive.
I am thinking of myself at the age of 8, but I am also thinking of the story I heard in the news.
A 52-year-old woman from Michigan was arrested for having written offensive, offensive messages to herself for a year from a fake Facebook account she had created.
For a whole year.
She tried to blame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend for this and I admit that when I heard it I reacted with admiration.
Because... Let's be honest.
What tremendous, albeit displaced, creativity.
This is something from a novel.
This is something from a novel by Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite writers.
She is the most brilliant and strange woman in American literature.
She is a writer of books called "Two strangers on the train" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley", all about how jealousy – which confuses our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in this realm of jealousy, in the membrane between what is and what could be – can be drilled in a moment.
Take Tom Ripley, their most famous figure.
First of all, Tom Ripley wants to be you and have what you have, then he is you and has what you once had, and you have disappeared like from the ground.
That is one method.
But what should we do? We cannot do it in the way Tom Ripley did.
I cannot give fours to the whole world, even though I would like to do it on some days.
It is a disgrace, because we live in a harsh time.
We live in a "mad-time".
We are all good citizens of the social media, who are envious of the currency, is it not?
Does the novel show us the way out?
Let's do what characters do when they're not sure, when they're in possession of a mystery.
Let us go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
Think of Holmes, think of his nemesis as Professor Moriarty, this brilliant criminal.
But I always liked [Inspector] Lestrade, the head of Scotland Yard with the face of a rat who desperately needs Holmes, who desperately needs Holmes genius, but it makes him worried.
That is so familiar to me.
Lestrade therefore needs his help, he regrets it and ashames of bitterness as it were in the course of the stories.
But as they work together, something begins to change and eventually in "The Six Napoleons" as Holmes comes in and stunned by his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and says: "We are not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
We are proud of you.'
He adds that there would be no one at Scotland Yard who would not shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
This is one of the few times we see Holmes moved in his stories, and I find this little scene very moving, but also mysterious.
It seems as if jealousy is not an emotional problem, but a physical problem.
At one moment, Holmes is on a different wavelength from Lestrade.
And the next moment they are on a wavelength.
Suddenly, Lestrade allows himself to admire the genius he had previously sought.
Is it really so easy?
What if jealousy were really only a physical problem, if it was only about how we "relate" to the others?
Perhaps we would not then be ashamed of someone's excellence.
We could move towards one another.
But I like contingency plans.
While we are waiting for this, we still have the literature as a consolation.
Literature alone reveals jealousy.
Literature alone can tame them, invites them.
And who all comes together: the good Lestrade, the frightening Tom Ripley, the mad Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We are in an excellent society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and on a camping trip with my father in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of the state of New York.
It was a wonderful day.
The forest sparkled.
The sun made the leaves look like tinted glass, and if there had been no path, one might almost have thought that we would be the first people to walk through this forest.
We went to our tent.
I saw the small hut on a cliff and looked over a crystal clear, beautiful lake when something dreadful struck me.
Behind the roof was a rubbish dump, perhaps 4 square meters, with apple kernels, a bundled aluminium foil and an old soccer shoe.
I was amazed, I was angry and I was confused.
The tenters were too lazy to bring away what they had brought – who, they thought, would clean up after them?
The question remained to me and I generalized it:
Who will pick up after us?
Whatever you turn it on or wherever the "us" may be, who is cleaning up behind us in Istanbul?
Who is cleaning up behind us in Rio, or in Paris or London?
Here in New York City, the municipal cleaning department takes up about 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recycling materials every day.
I wanted to get to know them – as individuals.
I wanted to understand who is doing the job.
How is it to wear a uniform and to bear this burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I went with the trucks, ran the routes, interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider.
I had to go deeper.
So I took a job as a cleaner.
I did not just drive with the trucks, I drove the trucks.
And I took the mechanical beams and plucked the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an exciting experience.
Everyone is asking about the smoke.
It is there, but not as present as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it quite quickly.
It is difficult to get used to the weight.
I know people who have done this job for several years, whose bodies have still got used to the weight they put on their bodies to carry tons of rubbish every week.
Then there is the danger.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Labour, the job of urban cleaning is one of the 10 most dangerous jobs in the country, and I learned why.
The hotel is very close to the city centre and the railway station.
Everyone wants to get away and often drivers don't take enough care.
This is really bad for the workers.
And the rubbish itself is full of poisons that fall down from the rubbish truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the mercilessness of waste.
If you step from the edge of the brickwork and see a city from the back of the rubbish truck, you can see that rubbish is like a force of nature itself.
It does not stop being created.
It is also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And then there is the stigma.
You put on your uniform and become invisible until someone gets angry – for whatever reason – because you block traffic with your car or take a break too close to your home, or drink a coffee in your bar, and they come and moan you and say they don’t want you in their neighborhood.
I find this stigma particularly ironic because I firmly believe that the cleaners are the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the guardians of public health.
If they did not remove the waste, efficiently and effectively every day, it would overflow from the containers and the associated dangers would threaten us in a very real way.
Diseases that we have been under control for decades and centuries would spread and harm us.
The economy needs it.
If we cannot throw away the old stuff, we have no room for the new, and the engines of the economy start to stumble when consumption is halted.
I am not advocating capitalism, I am simply referring to the interrelationship.
And then there is what I call our average, necessary, everyday speed.
By this I mean just how fast we are used to moving these days.
We do not take care of repairing, cleaning or carrying around our coffee cup, bag or water bottle.
We take them, throw them away, forget them because we know that there are people on the other side who are concerned about them.
Therefore, today I would like to propose some ways in which we can think about urban cleansing, to improve the stigma and bring it into this entertainment, how to create a city that is sustainable and humane.
I think that your work is somehow liturgical.
You see the streets every day, regularly.
They wear uniforms in many cities.
You know when you can expect them.
And their work allows us to do ours.
They are like reinsurance.
The process they maintain securely keeps us from ourselves, from our disengagement, from the disappeared, and this process must always be maintained at all costs.
The day after September 11, 2001, I heard the thunder of a rubbish truck on the street, grabbed my little son and walked down the stairs and there was a man going his paper recycling route, as he does every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for his work – on that day of every day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and noded and said, 'Everything will go well'.
'Everything will be fine'.
Only later did I start my research on urban cleanliness and met the man again.
His name is Paulie and we often worked together; eventually we became good friends.
I wanted to believe that Paulie was right.
Everything will be fine.
But in our efforts to change the way we exist as a species on this planet, we must also take into account all the costs, including the very human cost of labor.
And we would have to be informed to reach the people who do this work, their experience, how we think about how we can develop systems for sustainability that will break away from street recycling, which is a remarkable success of the last 40 years, over the United States of America and countries of the world, and bring us to a horizon where we can look at other types of waste that can be reduced through production and industrial sources.
Urban waste, which we think about when we talk about waste, accounts for three per cent of the national waste stream.
It is a remarkable statistic.
In your daily life, in the course of your life, the next time you see someone whose job it is to clean behind you, take a moment to perceive it.
Take a moment to say thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what is possible?
That is not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what is possible?
My name is Maysoon Zayid and I am not drunk, but the doctor during my birth is.
He cut my mother six times in six different directions and squeezed the air from poor little ones.
I therefore have infantile cerebral palsy, which means that I always puff all the time.
Look at it.
I am a cross of Shakira, Shakira and Muhammad Ali.
Cerebral palsy is not genetic.
It is not a birth defect; it cannot be inherited.
No one has witched my mother's uterus and I did not get it because my parents are first-class cousins as they are.
It is only possible to get it through accidents, such as the one that occurred on the day of my birth.
I must warn you, I am not a source of inspiration and I do not want anyone here to feel sorry for me, because you all dreamed of being disabled at some point in your life.
Please come along briefly.
It's just before Christmas in the shopping mall, you're spinning around looking for a parking space and what do you see?
Sixteen empty parking spaces for disabled people.
And you think, 'Why can't I be a little bit disabled?'
I must also tell you that I have 99 problems and cerebral palsy is just one of them.
If there were an Olympic of oppression, I would get a gold medal.
I am Palestinian, Muslima, female, disabled and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better now, then I don't know.
Cliffside Park in New Jersey is my hometown.
I love the fact that my illness and my place of residence have the same initials.
I also love the fact that I could walk from my home to New York City if I wanted.
Many people with CP do not run, but my parents did not believe in a "can not".
My father's mantra was: 'Yes, you can do that!
So when my three older sisters were washing, I was washing.
When my three older sisters went to a public school, my parents took the school system to court so that I could go and if we didn't get all one's, we all got my mother's slippers over-roasted.
My father taught me running when I was five, by putting my heels on his feet and simply walking around.
Another of his tactics was to let a dollar note float in front of my nose so I catch it.
My inner stripper was very strong, and as -- Yes. So, on the first day in the nursery I ran like a champion who had got one too much.
At that time there were only six Arabs in my town and all of them were my family.
Today we have 20 Arabs in the city and they are still all my family.
I do not think anyone has ever noticed that we are not Italians.
That was before September 11 and before politicians thought it appropriate to use 'I hate Muslims' as their campaign motto.
The people I grew up with did not have a problem with my faith.
They were very worried, however, that I might die of hunger during Ramadan.
I told them that I could live on my body fat for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to dusk was a breeze.
I played at Broadway.
They are very expensive and very expensive.
My parents couldn't afford physiotherapy, so they sent me to a dance school.
I learned how to dance on paragraphs, so I can walk on paragraphs.
And I'm from Jersey, where it's really important to be chic, so if my friends wore heels, so I too.
And if my friends spent their summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, then I did not.
I spent my summers in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if we did not go back to Palestine every summer, we would one day become like Madonna.
The summer holidays were often because my father wanted to cure me, so I drank deer milk, was shoved, was taken to the Dead Sea, and I still remember the water burning in my eyes and I thought, 'It works! It works!'
But we found a miracle cure: yoga.
I must say it is really boring, but before I did yoga I was a stand-up comedian who can't even stand.
Now I can stand on my head.
My parents always told me that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to play in the soap opera "General Hospital".
Because of the promotion of minorities, I got a great scholarship at Arizona State University, ASU, because I represented every minority.
I was almost the Cinderella of the Dramatic faculty.
Everyone loved me.
I did all the homework of the less clever children, got ones in all my courses, got ones in all their courses.
Every time I played a scene from "The Glass Menagerie", my teachers slept.
But I never got a role.
In my final year, the ASU finally planned a piece called "You dance in Jackson really slowly".
A play about a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I cheered everywhere: "Finally I get a role!
I have cerebral palsy!
Finally free!
Thank God, I am finally free!'
I did not get the role.
Sherry Brown got the role.
I was sitting at the head of the acting department, I screamed hysterically as if someone had shot my cat, and asked her why, she told me that they feared I wouldn’t get the stunts.
I said, "Sorry, but if I can't do the stunts, then the character can't do them either."
I was really born for this role and they gave it to an actress without CP.
The university imitated life.
Hollywood is famously known for having physically healthy actors play disabled people.
After finishing school, I moved home and played my first role as an actress in a soap opera.
My dream became a reality.
And I knew I would soon climb from "restaurant guest" to "crazy best girlfriend".
But instead I remained a glorified piece of furniture that was only visible at the back of my head, and I became aware that casting directors did not recruit loose-fisted, ethnic, disabled actors.
They only hired perfect people.
But exceptions confirm the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comrades-in-arms.
So I became a comedian.
My first job was to drive famous comedians from New York City to shows in New Jersey and I will never forget the face of the first comedian I ever drove when he realized he was riding on the road to New Jersey with a girl with CP as the driver.
I have performed in clubs all over the USA, and I have also performed in the Middle East in Arabic, uncensored and unveiled.
Some people say I am the first comedian in the Arab world.
I do not like to call myself the first, but I know they have never heard of the evil little rumour that women are not funny and they find us screamingly funny.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Americans of Arab origin in the media, while reminding casting directors that South Asia and Arabia are not synonymous.
Equality between Arabs was much, much easier than the challenge of tackling the stigma of disability.
My great breakthrough was in 2010.
I was invited as a guest to the news programme "Countdown with Keith Olbermann".
I entered as if I was dressed for the final ball, they pushed me into a studio and put me on a spinning chair with rolls.
So I looked at the stage manager and said, 'Sorry, can I get another chair?'
And she looked at me and said: 'Five, four, three, two '.
And we were live!
I had to sit at the table of the host to keep myself from rolling out of the screen during the scene, and when the interview was over I was alone.
I had a chance and I loved her, and I knew they would never invite me again.
But Mr. Olbermann not only invited me back, but made me a full-time employee and glued my chair.
I learned something very interesting when working with Keith Olbermann: all people on the Internet are rubbish bags.
People say children are cruel, but as a child or adult nobody has ever made fun of me.
In the World Wide Web, I am suddenly free of my disability.
When I watch online videos, I see comments like: "Hey, why is it so chicky?"
"Ah, is it stupid?"
And my favorite: "Poor hanging-up terrorist.
Is she ill?
We should pray for them.'
One even suggested that my disability be included in the credits: scriptwriter, comedian, cerebral palsy.
A disability is as visible as its origin.
If a wheelchair user cannot play Beyoncé, Beyoncé cannot play a wheelchair user.
The disabled are the biggest -- yes, that is worth applause.
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world and we are the most under-represented in the entertainment industry.
The doctors said I could never walk, but I am sitting here before you.
But if I had grown up with social media, I might not have been here.
I hope that together we can create a more positive image of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Perhaps there would be less hate on the Internet if there were more positive examples.
Or perhaps not.
Perhaps there is still a need for a village to educate a child well.
My trip around the world has brought me to a few very special places.
I was able to walk on the red carpet next to soap opera star Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus.
I was allowed to play in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the wonderful Dave Matthews.
I travelled around the world as the main character on the comedy tour "Arabs Gone Wild".
I was a representative of the large state of New Jersey in the Democratic National Committee in 2008.
I created Maysoon's Kids, a charitable organisation that tries to give Palestinian refugee children the fraction of the opportunity my parents gave me.
But the one moment that stands out most -- before this one -- the moment that stands out most was when I stood before the man who flies like a butterfly and stalks like a bee, who has Parkinson's and screams as much as I do: Muhammad Ali.
This was the only time my father ever saw a live performance from me, and I dedicate this talk to him in memory.
: May God be gentle to your soul, Dad, My name is Maysoon Zayid, "If I can, you can.
There was a time when we solved major problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed from Apollo 11 and descended to the Sea of Peace.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray moon surface was the culmination of a sustained, collective effort.
The Apollo program was the greatest peace mobilization in the history of the United States of America.
To get to the moon, NASA invested about $180 billion, which is the current value, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo created jobs for 400,000 people and required the cooperation of 20,000 companies, universities, and authorities.
People died, including the Apollo 1 crew.
But by the end of the Apollo program, 24 people flew to the moon.
Of the twelve that reached its surface, Aldrin is now the oldest, following the death of Armstrong last year.
But why did they go?
They did not bring much back: 380 kilograms of old rock and something that all 24 later stressed – a new sense of how our common home is small and fragile.
Why did they go? Cynically, President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better missiles.
But Kennedy’s own words from 1962 at Rice University give a better indication.
For contemporaries, Apollo was not just a victory for the West over the East during the Cold War.
At that time, the strongest feeling was a feeling of amazement at the supernatural powers of technology.
They flew to the moon because it was great.
The moon landing occurred against the backdrop of a long series of technological triumphs.
From the first half of the 20th century came the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and a tuberculosis vaccine.
In the middle of the century, polio and smallpox were eradicated.
Technology seemed to have something in it that Alvin Toffler called an "accelerating push" in 1970.
For most of human history, we could not move faster than a horse or a boat by sail, but in 1969 the Apollo 10 team flew at a speed of about 40,200 kilometers per hour.
Since 1970, no human beings have been on the moon.
No one has moved faster than the Apollo 10 crew, and the unconcerned optimism about the power of technology has been vaporized, because the major problems we hoped to solve with technology, such as flying to Mars, producing clean energy, healing cancer, or lifting the world from hunger, now seem insoluble.
I remember when I was five years old when I was a child.
when the Apollo 17 was taken off and my mother warned me not to look too much into the fiery exhaust of the Saturn V rocket.
I had a guess that this would be the last admission, but I was 100% sure that there would still be colonies on Mars in my life.
The expression'something happened to our ability to solve major problems with technology' has become a platitudes.
It is heard everywhere.
We have heard it here over the last two days at TED.
It looks as if technocrats have distracted us and enriched themselves with meaningless toys, such as iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up automatic business.
There is nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have extended and enriched our lives.
But they do not solve the great problems of mankind.
What has happened?
There is a blunt explanation from Silicon Valley, which admits that less ambitious companies have been funded recently than in the years when Intel, Microsoft, Apple, and Genentech were funded.
In Silicon Valley, it is said that the markets are to blame, particularly the premiums that risk investors offer to companies.
Silicon Valley says that risk investors have moved away from supporting world-changing ideas and instead encourage growing problems, or even invented problems.
But this explanation is not good enough to me.
It mainly explains what is wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even in their risk-friendly times, risk investors preferred small investments, tiny investments with a 10-year exit.
Investors have always had trouble investing profitably in technologies such as energy, which require huge equity and which are developing long and slowly, and risk investors have never, ever, funded the development of technologies that solve major problems without immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve a major problem are more complicated and deeper.
Sometimes we deliberately decide not to solve the major problems.
We could fly to Mars if we wanted.
NASA has even already sketched a plan.
But flying to Mars would be a political decision of public popularity, and therefore it will never happen.
We will not fly to Mars because everyone thinks that there are more important things to be done here on Earth.
Another time we cannot solve the major problems because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two per cent of the world's energy consumption comes from advanced renewable sources, such as solar, wind and biofuel, less than two per cent, and the reason for this is purely economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar energy and wind and oil are cheaper than biofuel.
We all want alternative energy sources that can keep up with the price, but there are none.
Now, developers, business leaders, and economists are in principle all agreed on what national practices and international agreements would drive the development of alternative energies: mainly, a significant increase in research and development of energy technologies and an increased price of carbon.
But in the current political climate there is no hope that US energy policy or international agreements will take up and reflect these opinions.
Sometimes deep problems that seemed technically solved are not.
It has long been believed that famines are due to the failure of food supplies.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that have disastrous consequences for food distribution.
Technologies can improve things like harvest yields or systems like storage and transport of food, but there will be famine as long as there are weak governments.
Ultimately, major problems are sometimes avoided because we do not understand the problem properly.
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but it soon became apparent that there are many types of cancer, most of which are awful resistant to treatment, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, realistic therapies seem to be becoming a reality.
Difficult problems are difficult.
It is not true that we cannot solve major problems with technologies.
We can, we must, but for that to happen, these four elements must all be present: leaders and the public must be interested in resolving a problem; institutions must support the solution; it must really be a technical problem; and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission, which became a kind of metaphor for technology’s ability to solve major problems, met these criteria.
But this is a model that cannot be repeated in the future.
It is not 1961.
There is no such dramatic-compelling struggle as the Cold War, no such politician as John Kennedy who turns everything difficult and dangerous into a hero’s act, and no popular science fiction mythology like the solar system.
Most of the time, however, it was easy to fly to the moon.
He was only three days away.
It is also debatable whether this really has solved a serious problem.
We are being asked to be self-sufficient and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to achieve.
God knows, we are not lacking in challenges.
Thank you.
I would invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine you are standing on your front door.
Consider the door, its color and the material it is made of.
Now imagine a group of overweight nudists on their bikes.
It is a naked bicycle race and they come to you and your doorstep.
You really have to imagine that.
They wrap themselves, sweat and wabble directly towards you.
And then they all crawl directly into your doorstep.
Wheels, wheels, everything flies everywhere, sticks are sliding in precarious places.
Now step over the threshold of your apartment into your hall, your corridors or whatever is on the other side of your door and enjoy the light breaking in the room.
The light shines on the crumb monster.
It beckons you from the back of a yellow-brown horse.
A talking horse.
You can almost feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
You smell the schokocek it sweeps into your mouth.
Go past him, go past your living room.
Here you can imagine Britney Spears with all the power of your imagination.
Her clothes cover only the essentials, she sings "Hit Me Baby One More Time" while she dancing on your living table.
Now follow me into your kitchen.
The ground has been replaced by a yellow pavement road and from your oven come Dorothy, the Tin Man, Bird-of-Prey and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz", walking hand in hand.
Well, open your eyes now.
I would like to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City.
It is called the United States Memory Championship.
A few years ago I wanted to report on this competition as a science journalist and expected to see the annual meeting of the island seekers.
It was a bunch of guys and a few ladies, of very different ages and hygiene standards.
They took hundreds of random numbers into account once they were viewed.
Learning the names of dozens and dozens of unknowns
and remembered whole poems in just a few minutes.
They competed to memorize the order of a mixed deck the quickest.
That is mad.
These people must have supernatural skills.
I started to talk to some of them.
Here is Ed Cook, a guy who comes from England and has one of the best trained memory there.
And I asked him, 'Ed, when did you notice that you had this particular talent?'
And Ed said, "I am not an island lover.
I only have an average memory.
Anyone who steps in here will confirm that he or she has only an average memory.
We have all trained ourselves, using ancient techniques, to do these incredible exercises of memory, techniques invented by the Greeks 2 500 years ago, techniques used by Cicero to memorise his speeches and by medieval scholars to memorise whole books.'
And I thought, "Wow, how is it that I have never heard of it?"
We were outside the race hall and Ed, this wonderful, brilliant, and somewhat eccentric English guy, says to me, " Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears?"
I said, 'What? No, why?'
"I would like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a mixed deck on U.S. television.
It would show the world that everyone can do it here'.
I said to him, 'I'm not Britney Spears, but you could teach me.
I mean you have to start somewhere, do you not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
A lot of the next year I spent not only training my memory, but also exploring it and understanding how it works, why it sometimes doesn’t work, and what its potential might be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is for example E.P.
He suffers from memory loss and probably has the worst memory in the world.
His memory is so bad that he does not even remember his memory problem, which is amazing.
Although it was so tragic, it offered insights into how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other side of the spectrum, I learned.
Kim Peek.
He was the template for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie Rain Man.
We spent an afternoon learning telephone books in the public library in Salt Lake City.
And I came back to read a whole pile of treatises on memory, treatises written 2 000 years ago and more in ancient Latin and later in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
I was particularly fascinated that there was a time when the idea of training, discipline, cultivating memory did not seem as remote as it appears today.
There was a time when people invested in their memory, where they spent a lot of money on furnishing it.
Over the last few millennia, we have invented a series of technologies – from the alphabet to the scroll, the code, the printing, photography, the computer, the smartphone – that have made it increasingly easy for us to store our memory externally, in principle to extract this fundamental human ability.
These technologies have enabled our modern world, but at the same time they have changed us.
They have changed us culturally and I would argue that they have changed us cognitively.
Without reminding you of the need, it sometimes seems as if we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on earth where people still passionately train, discipline and cultivate their memory is this unique memory contest.
In fact, it is not so unique, there are competitions like this all over the world.
And that struck me, I wanted to know how these people do it.
A few years ago, a research group at University College London brought a group of memory masters into the lab.
They wanted to know: is the structure or anatomy of their brains different from that of the rest of us?
The answer was no.
Are they wiser than we?
They gave them a pile of cognitive tests and the answer was: really not.
But there was an interesting and telling difference between the brain of a memory master and that of a controller with whom it was compared.
When you put them into a fMRI machine and scan their brains as they memorize numbers, faces, and images of snowflakes, you can see that the memory masters reveal different regions of the brain than the rest of us.
It seems as if they are using the part of their memory that is used for spatial remembering and navigating.
Why, and can we learn from this?
The best memory contest is dominated by a kind of arms race, in which each year someone trumpets a new technique to memorize more facts more quickly and the rest of the field has to catch up.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times World Memory Champion.
On the table in front of him are 36 mixed decks that he memorizes within an hour with a technique he invented and mastered alone.
He used a similar technique to memorize the exact order of 4 140 random binaries in half an hour.
Yes.
And although there are a multitude of techniques for memorising various things in these competitions, all of these techniques are based on the concept psychologists call "elaborative encoding".
The so-called baker/bakery paradox illustrates this concept very elegantly: if I ask two people to remember the same word and I say to you,'remember that there is a person called baker'.
That is its name.
And I say unto you, 'Remember there is a person who is a baker'.
If I come back to you at a later time and say, "Do you still know the word I said to you some time ago?
Do you know what word it was?"
The person who should remember the person called baker is less likely to remember the word than the person who should remember the person named baker.
The same word, different memory capacity; that is strange.
What is happening here?
Well, the name bakery does not mean you anything.
It is absolutely independent of all the memories that hover around in your head.
But the profession of baker, we know bakery.
Bakers wear funny white caps.
Bakers have flour in their hands.
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.
Perhaps we even know a bakery.
And when we hear the word first, we associate these associations with the word and make it easier to find the memory later.
The secret of what happens in memory contests, and the secret of remembering everyday things better, is to find a way to turn the name baker into the profession baker – an information that has no associations, neither in meaning nor in meaning, in a way that changes meaning and meaning in connection with all the fragments of memory that already exist.
One of the more sophisticated techniques can be dated back to 2 500 years to the ancient Greeks.
It became known as the Memorial Palace.
The story of its creation is as follows: there was a poet called Simonides who went to a feast.
He was responsible for entertainment, because when you wanted to throw a really big party, you didn't hire a D.J., you hire a poet.
He says that he is a very serious composer, and that he is a very serious composer.
Not only are they dead, but their bodies are distorted to the point of being invisible.
No one can say who was present, no one knows where who sat.
The bodies cannot be properly buried.
It is tragedy after tragedy.
Simonides, the only survivor of this disaster, is standing outside, closing his eyes and suddenly realizing that he can see in front of his inner eye which guest has been sitting where.
And thus he takes the remaining ones by his hand and leads them through the ruins to the dead.
At that moment Simonides understood something we all know intuitively already, that no matter how badly we can remember names, telephone numbers or literal instructions from our colleagues, we have a very good visual and spatial memory.
If I asked you to repeat the first ten words of the story of Simonides, you would find it difficult.
But I bet that if I asked you to remember who is sitting on a talking yellow-brown horse in your foyer at this moment, you could see it without any problem.
The idea of the Memorial Palace is to build a building in front of the inner eye and fill it with pictures of the things to be remembered – the more crazy, colorful, bizarre, funny, dirty, shimmering the picture, the more it burns into memory.
This is a advice which goes back to the Latin texts on memory, which are more than 2 000 years old.
So how does it work?
Suppose you are invited to give a talk at TED and you want to remember it, just as Cicero would have done if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2 000 years ago.
You could do it like this: imagine yourself in front of your front door.
Imagine a completely crazy and twisted story with unforgettable pictures to remind you that you want to talk about this totally crazy contest first.
And then you go into your house and see the crumb monster on Mr. Ed's back.
And that would remind you to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And when you see Britney Spears, you remember a funny anecdote you wanted to tell.
You go to your kitchen, and the fourth thing you wanted to talk about was this strange journey you went on for a year, and you have some friends who help you remember it.
Roman speakers remembered their speeches – not word for word, which only confuses, but subject by subject.
The English term "topic sentence" comes from the Greek word "topos", which means "place".
These are remnants of when people thought about speeches and rhetoric in spatial terms.
The wording 'at first' actually means 'at first in your memory'.
I found all this simply fascinating and still am still a fan of it.
Also, he went to some other memory competitions.
I wanted to write a little longer about this subculture of competitive remembrance.
But there was a problem.
The problem is that memory competitions are dead-lasting events.
It is like a group of people sitting there and writing a test.
It is quite exciting to see someone rub his feet.
I am a journalist, I need something worth writing about.
I know that the most breathtaking things happen in these people's minds, but I have no access to them.
So, if I wanted to tell this story, I had to put myself in their position.
And so I started to learn something from memory every morning, 15 to 20 minutes before I went to the newspaper.
Perhaps a poem or a poem.
the names from an old yearbook I bought at the flea market.
I found it to be incredibly fun.
I never imagined that.
It was fun because it was not about training memory.
You want to always be better and better at dreaming of these crazy, colorful, dirty, funny and hopefully unforgettable pictures in front of your inner eye.
I went into it.
Here I am with my standard memory competition training kit.
A pair of ear protectors and a protective glasses covered with only two small stripes, because distraction is the greatest enemy of the memory racer.
I went to the same competition I went to a year earlier.
and I thought I would participate in it, just as a journalistic experiment.
It could be a nice epilogue for my investigations.
The problem was that the experiment did not run as planned.
I won the race, which really should not have happened.
It was nice to memorize speeches and telephone numbers and shopping lists but that was not what I wanted to achieve.
These are just tricks.
Tricks that work because they build on some simple ideas about how our brain works.
You don't have to build memory palaces or memorize decks to benefit from the insight into how your memory works.
We often talk about people with a good memory as if it were a special talent, but that is not true.
Good memory is anachronism.
We remember things better if we are careful.
We remember when we are engaged.
We remember when we have the opportunity to find out why information and experience are important to us, why they are important and why they stand out, when we can transform them into something that makes sense to us in relation to our other memories.
The memory palace, these memory techniques, are all just shortcuts.
In fact, they are not even real abbreviations.
They work because they force us to work.
They force us to process and be attentive in a way that we are not normally.
But they are not shortcuts.
This is how things are anchored in memory.
I would like to share with you one thing, something I learned from E.P., the man who didn't even remember his memory problem: our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we prepared to lose from our already short lives by constantly looking at our Blackberry or iPhone instead of paying attention to the person talking to us?
I have learned that memory, in each of us, has incredible capacities.
If we want to live a life worthy of remembering, we must be the person who does not forget to remember.
Thank you.
At the age of 27, I left a busy job in corporate consulting for an even more busy job: teaching.
I taught math for seventh grade students at public schools in New York.
Like any teacher, I did tests and exams.
I gave up my homework.
When the work came back, I calculated notes.
But IQ was not the only difference between the best and worst pupils.
The IQ's of some of my strongest students were not stratospheric.
Some of my smartest children didn't do very well.
That made me think.
What you learn in maths in the 7th grade is already difficult: rational numbers, decimal numbers, the area of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible, I was firmly convinced that all my students could learn the subject if they worked long and hard enough.
After a few more years in school, I came to the conclusion that we needed a much better understanding of pupils and learning from a motivational, psychological perspective in education.
What we can measure best in education is the IQ, but what if progress in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom and went on to study as a psychologist.
I started to study children and adults in all kinds of ultra-demanding situations, always wondering who is successful and why.
My research team and I went to the West Point Military Academy.
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in the troop training and which would not.
We went to the national book signing competition and tried to predict which children would get the most out of it.
We examined young teachers who worked in very difficult residential areas and asked which teachers would still teach there at the end of the school year and which would most effectively improve their pupils’ learning results.
We established partnerships with private companies and asked which vendors kept their jobs.
and who would earn the most money.
In all these different contexts, one feature emerged as a significant indication of success.
We did not have social intelligence.
It was not good looks, physical health and it was not IQ.
It was perseverance.
Resilience is passion and endurance for very long-term goals.
Resilience is stability.
Resilience is when you stick to a plan for the future, not just for a week or a month, but for years, and really work hard to make that plan a reality.
Resilience is life like a marathon, not sprint.
Some time ago, I started teaching resilience in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of lower-secondary students to fill in stamina questionnaires, and then waited over a year to see who finished.
It turned out that children with higher resilience were much more likely to finish school, even if I compared all measurable characteristics, such as family income, results in standardized tests, even how safe they felt in school.
Resilience therefore counts not only in Westpoint and in the bookbinding competition, but also in school, especially for children at risk of breaking down.
The most frightening thing about this issue, for me, is that we know so little, that science knows so little about how to build it.
Every day parents and teachers ask me: "How do we support children's resilience?"
How do I teach children a sound working moral?
How do I think they are motivated for distance races?"
The honest answer is: I do not know.
What I know is that talent alone does not give you perseverance.
Our data clearly shows that many talented people simply do not remain faithful to their dedication.
In fact, our findings suggest that resilience is not usually talent-related, but even inversely correlated with talent.
So far, the best idea I have heard about building resilience is the so-called growth-oriented attitude.
This idea was developed by Carol Dweck at Stanford University and includes the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, but that it can change with your efforts.
Dr. Dweck has shown that children who read about the brain and learn how it changes and grows in response to challenges are much more likely to survive in failures because they do not believe that failure is a permanent state.
This growth-oriented attitude is a great idea for building endurance.
But we need more.
I shall end my comments here, because we have already reached that stage.
That is the work that lies ahead of us.
We must maintain and test our best ideas and strong intuitions.
We must measure whether we have been successful; we must be prepared to fail, to be wrong, to learn lessons and to start from scratch.
In other words, we need to have resilience in giving our children more resilience.
Thank you.
At the heart of my work is the connection of reflections on our community life and be part of the environment, where architecture grows from natural, local conditions, and traditions.
Today I brought two current projects as an example of this.
Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and one in Tunisia.
They also have in common that the various analyses from different perspectives become an essential part of the final architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a multi-storey shopping mall in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.
This is the kind of building that was shown to us, my team and myself as an example of what we should design.
First I thought I was going to walk away.
After seeing a few of these buildings – there are many of them in the city – we realized that they have three essential features.
Firstly, these buildings are almost empty because they house very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, they need a huge amount of energy because the surfaces are made of glass, which generates heat inside, and then you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this should not happen, because they have quite mild weather, which is between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.
And, third, its image has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
This is a pity in a place with such a rich culture and tradition.
Furthermore, during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really fascinated by the old market with this open-air structure, where thousands of people go and shop, daily at small traders.
It also has this idea of public space that uses the exterior to create activity.
So I thought that this is exactly what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could design a multi-storey, contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge came when we looked at the plot, because it is in a real growth area of the city, where most of the buildings that you see in the picture were not there yet.
It is also located between two parallel roads which have no connection for hundreds of metres.
First of all, we created a connection between these two streets and placed all the entrances of the building there.
This is continued in a tiled atrium that creates an open air space in the building, which protects itself by its own shape from sun and rain.
To this hollow space we placed the idea of a market with small shops that change in each floor, because of the shape of the hollow space.
I also thought: how do we close the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to local climate conditions.
I started to think about textiles, like a bowl of concrete with perforations that allow the air and the light, but in filtered form.
Then these beautiful buttons inspired me from the clothes of Ethiopian women.
They have the characteristics of a fractal geometry and that helped me to design the entire facade.
We build it with these small prefabricated components, the windows that let air and light into the building in a controlled way,
and this is complemented by these small, coloured glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
It was not easy to convince the builders with these ideas at the beginning, because they thought: 'This is not a shopping mall, we didn't order it'.
But then we all realised that this idea of the market is much more profitable than the idea of a shopping centre, because they can actually sell more shops.
The facade concept was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because we did not need air conditioning anymore.
So we made some cost savings, which we used to realize the project.
The first implementation was to consider how we could make the building energy self-sufficient, in a city that has almost daily power cuts.
We made a valuable contribution by fitting solar panels on the roof.
In these panels we imagined the roof as a new public space with lounges and bars that creates this urban oasis.
These rooftop roofs collect water for reuse in the sanitary facilities.
Hopefully at the beginning of next year, because we have already finished the construction up to the 5th floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2000 houses and facilities in Tunis.
In order to carry out a great project, the biggest project I had ever designed, I had to really understand the city of Tunis, but also the surroundings, traditions and culture.
During this analysis I especially noticed the Medina, which is the 1000 year old structure, enclosed by a wall, accessible by 12 gates, and connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the plot, the first step was to extend the existing streets to create the first 12 blocks, with similar size and features to those in Barcelona and other European cities with these farms.
In addition, we chose some strategic points based on the concept of these gates and connected them with straight lines, which changed the original pattern.
The last step was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
What would be the best orientation in a Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
This is North-South, because of the temperature difference between the two sides of the house, which is created and which generates natural ventilation.
So we put a pattern on it that ensures that most apartments are perfectly aligned in this direction.
And that is the result, it is almost like a combination of a European bloc and the Arab city.
There are blocks with courtyards and on the ground floor there are all these connections for pedestrians.
It also complies with local regulations which stipulate a higher density in the upper floors and a lower density in the ground floor.
It also reinforces the concept of gates.
The spacious apartments are located in the heart of the city, surrounded by a huge park and a swimming pool.
The roof, my favourite place in this project, gives the community almost the space taken by the construction.
There, all neighbours can go up and get together and do things like a 2-km run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.
These two examples have a common approach to the drafting process.
They are in emerging countries, where cities can literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the current and future lives of people changes local communities and economic systems as fast as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I think it is more important that architecture seeks simple but affordable solutions that strengthen the relationship between the community and the environment and which aim to connect nature and people.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trust and I want to remind you of the common opinions about trust.
They are so ubiquitous that they have become a cliché.
I think there are three of them.
Firstly, one claim: confidence is sharply declining, many believe.
Then there is an objective: we should have more confidence.
And one task: we should rebuild confidence.
I believe that the claim, the goal and the task are based on false ideas.
I would like to tell you another story about a claim, an objective and a task that offer a much better approach to the matter.
First, the claim: Why do people think that confidence has fallen?
And if I really think about it with my current knowledge, I do not know the answer.
Perhaps it has decreased in some activities or facilities and perhaps in others.
I do not have an overview.
But I can of course look at the surveys, which are supposedly the source of the belief that confidence has fallen.
If you look at opinion polls over a period, there is not much evidence of this.
So, as it were, the people who were distrusted 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, are still distrusted.
And the people who were very familiar 20 years ago are still very familiar: judges, nurses.
We are in between, and the average citizen is almost in the middle.
But is that good evidence?
Opinion polls – clearly – raise opinions.
What else could they raise?
So you are looking at people's general attitudes when certain questions are asked.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
If someone asked you now, do you trust vegetable traders?
Do you trust fishermen?
Do you trust primary school teachers?
- then you would ask: 'To what extent exactly?'
That would be a sensible response.
And if you understand the answer, you may say: 'I trust some of them, but not others'.
All rational.
In short, in our short lives we try to establish trust in various ways.
We do not expect to trust every official or representative in an official or institutional body in the same way.
For example, I could say that I trust a certain primary school teacher I know to teach reading to the first grade, but I would not let her go on the school bus.
Perhaps I know by chance that she doesn't drive well.
I trust my most shaven girlfriend will keep a conversation going, but perhaps not that she will keep a secret.
Simply.
When we think about trust in more abstract terms, we often forget that it is a very important principle.
The surveys do not give very good information on the real level of confidence, because they ignore the common sense that is applied in confidence matters.
Secondly, we come to the end.
The aim is to increase trust.
To be honest, I find the target stupid.
That is not what I would be aiming at.
I would try to trust the trusted more, but not the trusted less.
I even actively aim to avoid trusting those who are not trustworthy.
And those who put their savings in the hands of a certain Mr. Madoff who, as the name suggests, then made himself out of the dust ["made off"] then I think, well, too much trust.
"More trust" is not a smart goal in this life.
The goal should be to use and refuse trust wisely.
And then we say, yes, okay, so what is most important is not trust, but trustworthiness.
To be able to assess the trustworthiness of people.
And to do that, we need to look at three things:
Are they competent, are they honest, are they reliable?
If we find a person competent, reliable and honest in the relevant areas, then we have a good reason to trust him, then he is trustworthy.
If the person is unreliable, then probably not.
Some of my friends are competent and honest, but I would not let them send a letter because they are forgotten.
I have friends who very much trust their own expertise, but they overestimate them by a great deal.
And I am very glad that I do not have many friends who are competent and reliable but dishonest.
If it is, I haven't recognized it yet.
But that is what we are looking for: first credibility, then trust.
Confidence is the response.
We have to assess the credibility of the confidence, and that is of course difficult.
Over the last few decades we have tried to establish control systems for all kinds of institutions and experts and bodies, which make it easier for us to assess their credibility.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They do not work as intended.
A midwife once said to me: 'The problem is that the paperwork takes longer than bringing the baby into the world'.
This problem is being created everywhere in our public everyday lives, in our institutions, and this control system is supposed to ensure credibility and trustworthiness, but it is doing the opposite.
It distracts people like midwives from their difficult tasks by having to tick the boxes first.
Each example can certainly contribute to this.
So much for the goal.
The goal is to increase trustworthiness, and that will be difficult if we want to be trustworthy and communicate that to others, and if we want to assess whether other people, or civil servants or politicians, are trustworthy.
It is not easy, it is a matter of appreciation, and simple reactions or attitudes are not enough.
And now to the task.
To describe it as a reconstruction of confidence reverses the issue.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
We can of course do that for ourselves.
We can gain a little credibility.
This way, two people can improve their trust in each other.
But, ultimately, trust is characterized by being given to one by others.
You cannot rebuild what others give you.
You have to give them a basis on which they trust you.
You must therefore be trustworthy.
This is of course because you cannot usually fool everyone at the same time.
But you must also provide evidence that you are trustworthy.
How can this be done?
This is happening every day, everywhere, and normal people, civil servants, offices, do it very effectively.
Here is a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks takes them back and they do not ask me any questions.
You take them back and give me the money back, or a few of the socks in the desired color.
I trust them because they have shown themselves to be vulnerable to me.
There is an important morality in this.
If you show yourself to be vulnerable to the other person, that is a very good sign that you are trustworthy and that you believe your own words.
So our objective is not very difficult to see in principle.
They are relations between trusted people, and the ability to judge when and whether the other is trustworthy.
So the moral of history is to think much less about trust, or about attitudes to trust that are correctly or incorrectly determined by opinion polls, and much more about trustworthiness, and how to give people adequate, useful, and simple evidence of their trustworthiness.
Thank you.
You know, the best part of being a father is the movies I can watch.
I love to watch my own favorite movies with my children.
The film has not let them go for months.
Her favorite character was of course Glinda.
So she had a good excuse to wear a glittering dress and a magic wand.
But if you watch this movie often enough, you will see how extraordinary it is.
We live in the present day and grow up our children in a kind of spectacular child fantasy industrial machine.
But "The Wizard of Oz" was different.
He did not start this trend.
It took 40 years for this trend to spread, with – interestingly – another film in which a metal guy and a very furry guy rescued a girl by disguising themselves as the enemy’s guards.
You know what I am talking about, do you?
Exactly.
Well, there is a big difference between these two films, even several big differences between "The Wizard of Oz" and all the films we are watching today.
First of all, there is very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz".
The monkeys are quite aggressive, as are the apple trees.
But I think if Oz's Wizard had been produced today, the Wizard would have said: "Dorothy, you are Oz's saviour, prophesied to us.
Use your magical shoes to defeat the armies of the evil witch of the West, created by computers."
But that is not how it is.
Another thing I find very unique about Oz's Wizard is that the most heroic, smart and even cruel characters are female.
I first noticed this when I showed my daughter Star Wars, which was years later, and the situation was different.
At that time I also had a son.
He was only three years old at the time.
He was not invited to the cinema evening, because he was too young for that.
But he was the second child and he was much less supervised than his sister.
So he sneaked in and he remembered the film as a ducks' chicken remembers his mother, and I do not think he understood what was going on, but he certainly absorbed it.
And I wondered what he had added up.
Has he grasped that it is about courage, tenacity and loyalty?
Has he caught Luke joining an army to overthrow the government?
Has he noticed that there are only boys in the universe, except for Aunt Beru and of course this princess who is really cool, but who is actually waiting most of the time so that she can reward the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he did thanks to the magic with which he was born?
Compare that with "The Wizard of Oz" of 1939.
How does Dorothy make her film a good end?
By becoming a friend of everyone and a leader.
That is the kind of world I would rather have my children in – Oz, do you? – and not in the world where guys fight each other, which is pretty much the same as our world today.
Why is there so much power – big M, power – in the films that we have for our children, and so few yellow brick roads?
There is a lot of good literature about the impact of films about violent boys on girls, and you should read it, it is very good.
However, I didn't read so much about how boys deal with this influence.
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not give me the appropriate model that I could use to find the adult world in which girls and boys are taught together.
I think there was that moment with the first kiss when I really expected the ending to start, because that is how a movie ends, right?
I finished my mission, I took the girl.
Why are you still standing around?
I do not know what to do.
The films are very focused on defeating the villain and getting his reward, and there is not much room for other relationships and other travels.
It almost looks like a boy is a stupid animal and when you are a girl you should bring your war costumes.
There are a whole host of exceptions to this and I will defend the Disney Princesses from any of you.
But they are sending out a message to the boys that they are not the target audience.
They are fabulous in teaching girls how to defend themselves against patriarchy, but they do not necessarily teach boys how to defend themselves against patriarchy.
There are no models for them.
There are also some great women who write new stories for our children and who are as three-dimensional and wonderful as Hermione and Katniss, they are still war films.
And the most successful studio of all times, of course, produces classics one after the other, and each of them is about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who bring up a little girl.
Until – as many of you will remember – this year, when they finally released the film "Merida – Legend of the Highlands".
I recommend it to all of you, it is available on the Internet.
Do you remember what the critics said when "Merida" came out?
"Ah, I can't believe that Pixar made a princess movie."
It is very good, so do not be deterred.
But hardly any of these films passed the Bechdel test.
I do not know whether you have heard about it.
It has not yet become very significant and established itself, but perhaps we will be taking action today.
Alison Bechdel is a comic book author and during the mid-1980s she recorded this conversation with a friend about the evaluation of the films they had seen.
It is quite simple, there are only three questions you need to ask: is there more than one character in the movie who is a woman and says something?
Try to fulfil this requirement.
And do these women talk to each other at some point in the film?
And is their conversation about anything other than the guy they love?
Thank you for that.
Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about something.
I have seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the films we know and love.
Indeed, this week I went to the cinema to see a very good movie, "Argo".
You remember the fuss about the Oscars, great ratings, and a general consensus about what a good Hollywood movie is.
He falls through the Bechdel test with flying flags.
I do not think he should, because much of the film – I do not know whether you have seen it – but much of the film is about a message in which men and women hide during the hostage-taking.
There are some good scenes where men in this hideaway have deep, fearful conversations and the big moment one of the actresses has is to pass through a door and say, 'Come to bed, dear?'
That is how some people imagine Hollywood.
So let us take a look at the figures.
In 2011, among the 100 most popular movies, what do you think how many of those actually had female lead actresses?
Eleven is not a bad thing.
It is not as many as the number of women we have just elected to Congress, so that is good.
But there is a figure that is larger than this and that will shake this space.
Last year, the New York Times published a study carried out by the government.
It says that
one in five women in the US claims that they have already been sexually induced in their lives.
I do not think that this is the fault of the general entertainment culture.
I do not believe that children's films have anything to do with this.
I do not even think that music videos and pornography have anything directly to do with it, but something is going wrong and when I hear this statistic one thing I think is that these are many sex offenders.
What are these types learning?
What do they not manage to learn?
Do you take the story that it is the job of a male hero to defeat the villain with force and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and does not speak?
Do we take this story in this way?
As a parent who has the privilege of bringing up a daughter, as well as those of you who do the same, we find this world and these statistics very alarming and we want to prepare for them.
We have means such as 'girls' power and we hope that this will help, but I also wonder whether girls' power will protect them if we teach our sons, actively or passively, at the same time, to maintain their 'boys' power.
The 'NNTP' is a tool with which we can do something very important, and I am speaking primarily to the fathers.
I think we simply need to show our sons a new definition of masculinity.
The definition of masculinity is already changing.
You have read how the new economy is changing the role of housewife and bread earner.
They are being muddled up.
Our sons will have to find a way to adapt to, to enter into a new relationship with each other, and I think we really must show them that a real man is someone who trusts and respects his sisters and wants to stand on their side and stand up to the really evil boys who want to abuse women.
I think we should use the 'NETF' queue to look for films that pass the Bechdel test if we can find them, and look for the heroines that there are who have real courage, who bring people together and who get our sons to identify with these heroines and say, 'I want to be on your side' because they will be on their side.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars", do you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do these two have in common?
Perhaps it is not just the glittering dress.
I think these two figures are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie who know more than anyone else and love to share their knowledge with others to help them fully realize their potential.
They are also leaders.
I like this kind of job for my daughter and I like this kind of job for my son.
I want more tasks like this.
I want fewer tasks where my son is told 'get out and fight alone' and more tasks where he is supposed to join a team, perhaps a team led by a woman, to help others become better people and be better people, like the Oz Wizard.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about the story of a small town child.
I do not know his name, but his history.
He lives in a small village in the south of Somalia.
His village is close to Mogadishu.
The drought caused the poverty of this village and the coming famine.
When there was nothing left to keep him there, he left his village and went to the city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no work, no way out.
In the end, he falls into a camp outside Mogadishu.
It may be a year, but nothing.
One day he is approached by a man who invites him to lunch, then to dinner, then to breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of young people and they give him a chance.
He gets a little money to buy new clothing and to send money home to his family.
He is presented with this young woman.
Finally, he marries.
He starts a new life.
His life has a meaning.
On a beautiful day in Mogadishu, under the azure sky, an auto bomb goes into the air.
This small town child with big city dreams was the suicidal and bombing man, and this dynamic group of young people was al-Shabaab, a terrorist organisation with links to al-Qaeda.
How could the story of a small town child who simply tried to realize himself in the big city end up blowing himself up?
He had waited.
He had waited for an opportunity, for the future, for a way out, and it was the first opportunity that he had been given.
It was the first thing that took him out of a state we call "Waithood".
And its history is repeated time and again in urban areas around the world.
It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth that is stirring up riots in Johannesburg and London and seeking something other than "Waithood".
Young people are looking for opportunities, jobs, wealth in the city, their big city dreams, but young people are not getting a share of the prosperity of their cities.
It is often young people who suffer from high unemployment.
In 2030, three in five urban residents will be under the age of 18.
If we do not involve young people in the growth of cities, if we do not offer them opportunities, then waithood, the beginning of terrorism, violence and gangways will make up Cities 2.0.
In my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70% of young people are unemployed.
70% have no work, do not go to school.
They are not doing anything at all.
Last month I went back to Mogadishu and I went to the Madina Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of this destroyed hospital and wondering what would have happened if I had never left here?
What if I had been forced to the same state of "Waithood"?
Would I Have Become a Terrorist?
I am not sure what to reply.
The reason for my stay in Mogadishu this month was actually to organise a summit for young managers and entrepreneurs.
I brought together around 90 young Somali leaders.
We sat down together and brainstormed solutions to the biggest challenges of their city.
In the room was a young man, Aden.
He went to university in Mogadishu and graduated from it.
There was no work and no opportunities.
I remember him telling me that having a university degree, being unemployed and frustrated, the perfect target was to become a member of al-Shabaab and other terrorist organisations.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story is taking a different course.
In Mogadishu, the biggest obstacles to getting from A to B are the roads.
23 years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, so the motorcycle is the best means of transport.
Aden recognized the opportunity and grasped it.
He opened a motorcycle shop.
He began to rent motorcycles to locals who could not afford them otherwise.
With the help of his family and friends he bought 10 motorcycles and he is dreaming of increasing his business to a few hundred some time in the next three years.
How is this story different from the other?
What makes the difference?
I believe it is his ability to recognise and take advantage of a new opportunity.
It is the entrepreneurial spirit and I believe that entrepreneurial spirit can be the most effective remedy against waithood.
It encourages young people to create the economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking.
You can teach young people to be entrepreneurs.
I would like to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings: Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
He helped me to train the entrepreneurial spirit of some of the young people who attended the summit and show them how to be innovative and develop entrepreneurship.
He is indeed the first florist Mogadishu has seen for 22 years and until recently, before Mohamed was here, artificial shrubs, which came by boat from abroad, were used to have flowers on his wedding.
When someone was asked, "When did you last see fresh flowers?" the answer of many who grew up during the civil war was "never."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He founded a landscape garden with a flower shop.
He set up a plantation outside Mogadishu and started to grow tulips and lilies which, he said, could survive in the harsh climate of Mogadishu.
He began to supply wedding flowers, designed private gardens and shops around the city, and is currently working on the first public park in Mogadishu for 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a place where families and young people can come together and enjoy, as he says, the beautiful things of life.
Just to say the least: he does not breed roses because they need too much water.
The first step is therefore to inspire young people, and in this room Mohamed's presence had a great impact on the other young people in the room.
They never really thought about starting a business.
They thought of working for an NGO or for the government, but this story, his innovation, had a strong influence on them.
He encouraged them to see their city as a place of possibilities.
He encouraged them to be entrepreneurs, to be able to bring about change.
At the end of the day they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges of their city.
They had entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.
The inspiration of young people and the creation of an entrepreneurial spirit is a really great step, but young people need capital to be able to put their ideas into practice.
They need expertise and support to guide them, develop and start their business.
Connect young people with the resources they need, give them the support they need to make ideas come true and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship means more than just starting a business.
It is about creating social effects.
Mohamed does not just sell flowers.
I believe it is selling hope.
Its so-called "Peace Park", when created, will change the way people see their city.
Aden hired street children to help him rent and maintain the bikes.
He gave them the chance to escape from the crippling state of "Waithood".
These young businesses have a huge impact on their cities.
My proposal is therefore: make young people entrepreneurs, initiate and promote their own innovations and you will get more stories about flowers and 'peace parks' rather than about car bombs and 'Waithood'.
Thank you.
During my childhood in Maine, one of my favorite occupations was looking for sand dollars on the coast of Maine because my parents said that it was good luck.
But these shells are hard to find.
They are covered in sand, hardly visible.
But after a certain time I had developed a routine.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This developed into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archaeology.
And when I finally started studying Egyptology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes was not enough.
Suddenly, in Egypt, my small beach in Maine grew to become eight hundred miles long along the Nile, and my sand dollars grew to the size of cities.
This led me to use satellite pictures.
I had to look differently in order to be able to draw a map of the past.
I will show you how we see things differently, for example, when we use infrared.
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes.
The spot appears apparently brown, but if we use infrared and paint it with the wrong color, this spot suddenly becomes light pink.
What you see here are the chemical changes in the landscape caused by the construction materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians.
What I would like to share with you today is how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city called Itj-taui, which was lost for thousands of years.
Itj-taui was the capital of Old Egypt for more than four hundred years, in an era called the Middle Kingdom, about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in Egyptian Al-Fayyum and is very important because there was a great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion in the Middle Kingdom.
Egyptologists have always known that the site of Itj-taui was located somewhere near the pyramids built by the two kings, which are shown here with the red circles, but somewhere in this massive slope.
This area is huge – it is four miles by three miles.
In the past, the Nile flowed directly past Itj-taui, and as its course changed and shifted westward, it covered the city.
So how can you find a buried city in such a vast landscape?
Finding them by chance would be the equivalent of finding the needle in the haystack, with tied eyes and baseball gloves.
Therefore we used NASA's typography data to make a map of the landscape to see through slight changes.
where the course of the Nile used to be.
But you see more precisely, and this is very interesting, this slightly raised area, indicated with the circle, which seemed to us as a possible position for the town of Itj-taui.
We have therefore worked with Egyptian scientists to carry out hollow core drilling, as you can see here.
This is like drilling in ice, but instead of looking for layers that indicate climate change, you are looking for layers that indicate human occupation.
At a depth of five meters, under a thick layer of mud, we found a thick layer of clay shards.
This shows that at this possible position for Itj-taui, at five metres depth, we can find a layer inhabited for several hundred years, going back to the Middle Kingdom, the exact epoch in which we suspect the existence of Itj-taui.
We also found stone – carnelian, quartz and agate – which shows that a jewellery maker worked here.
This may not look much, but if you look at the most common stones used by jewelers in the Middle Kingdom, you will find exactly these stones.
We found a dense layer of housing on this site, which dates back to the Middle Kingdom.
We also found evidence of a jewel for the noble society, which shows that this must have been a very important city.
There was no Itj-taui yet, but we will soon return to this place to draw a map.
More importantly, we have funding for young Egyptians to be trained in satellite technology so that they can make equally great discoveries.
I therefore wanted to end with my favourite quotation from the Middle Kingdom – it was perhaps written in the town of Itj-taui four thousand years ago:
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all vocations.
There is nothing like it in the country."
TED was not founded in 1984 BC.
But having ideas actually began in 1984 BC in a town not long lost, found from above.
This is hardly comparable to shell hunting on the beach.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, and one of my most beautiful memories is how my mother showed me the beauty, shape and shape of Chinese characters.
Since then, I have been fascinated by this incredible language.
But it seems as insurmountable to an outsider as China’s Great Wall.
In recent years I have been wondering how I can break this wall so that anyone interested in this complex language can understand and appreciate it.
I thought a new quick method of learning Chinese would be useful.
Since the age of 5 I have learned to draw every single line for every dash in the correct sequence.
For the next 15 years I learned new characters every day.
Since we only have 5 minutes, a faster and easier method would be very useful.
A Chinese scholar understands about 20,000 characters.
You only need 1,000 characters for a simple understanding of the script.
The most important 200 enable you to understand 40% of the basic literature – enough to understand street signs, menus and the basic idea of certain websites or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight characters to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it is square.
This becomes a "mouth".
This man is walking.
"Man".
If the outline for "fire" shows a person with high arms as if he were crying: "Help, I burn!"... The font is originally derived from the shape of the fire, but I like that idea, take the one you like best.
That is a tree.
"tree".
This is a'mountain'.
The "Sun".
The "moon".
The inscription for "door" looks like a saloon door from the Wild West.
These eight characters are radicals.
They are the foundation for a variety of characters.
A person.
If there is someone behind it, it means "follow".
If there are more, then two means "escort" and three means "people crowd".
When a man stretches his arms wide, he says: 'It was so 'large''.
The man in the mouth, he is like locked up.
He is a "prisoner", just like Jonas in the whale.
A tree stands for a tree, two trees together for a "forest".
Three together represent a "forest".
Put a plank under the tree and you have a "base".
If you put a mouth on top of it, it means "idiot".
Easy to remember, because a talking tree is quite idiotic.
Do you remember the fire?
Two flames over one another mean "hot".
Three fires together make many "fires".
Put the fire under two trees, it means "burn".
For us, the sun is the source of wealth.
Two suns together make "wealthy".
Three together are "spark".
When the Sun and the Moon shine together, it means "brightness".
In this context, it may also be for the next day.
The sun rises above the horizon: sunrise.
A board in the door stands for the "bar".
Place a mouth in the door, it means "Ask Questions".
Knock, knock, is there anyone?
This person is walking out of the door.
On the left is the "woman".
Two women together represent a "dispute".
Caution with three women: this means'marriage breakdown'.
We have now learned about 30 characters.
With this method you can make 32 words from the first eight radicals.
The next group of eight characters makes another 32 words.
With a little effort you can learn a few hundred characters like an eight-year-old Chinese child.
When we can these characters, we start to put them together.
For example, mountain and fire together make up the fire mountain, i.e. a "vulcan".
We know that Japan is the country of the rising sun.
This is the Sun with the "origin", because Japan is located east of China.
A sun combined with the origin means "Japan".
A Man Behind Japan?
A 'Japanese'.
The letters on the left are two mountains stacked over each other.
In classic Chinese, it means "exile," because Chinese emperors sent their political enemies to exile over the mountains.
Today, exile has become "going out".
A mouth that says where it goes out stands for "outside".
This is the foil that reminds me to leave the stage.
Today I will tell you about the history of architecture over the last 30 years.
That is a lot of time for 18 minutes.
It is a complex topic, so we start directly from a complex place: New Jersey.
30 years ago, as a six-year-old, I lived with my parents in a town in New Jersey called Livingston, and that was my child's room.
Near my bedroom was the bathroom which I shared with my sister.
Between my bedroom and bathroom was a balcony with view to the living room.
Everyone went up there and watched TV, so everyone saw me when I went from the bedroom to the bathroom, and whenever I showered and came back in a towel, everyone saw me.
And I looked like that.
I was rude, unsure and I hated it.
I hate this hall, this balcony, I hate this room and this house.
And that is architecture.
This feeling, my emotions at that time, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics and planning, it is about the deep, emotional connections we have with places where we live.
And it is no wonder that we feel this way, because, according to [the Environmental Protection Agency], EPA, Americans spend 90% of their time inside.
We are therefore surrounded by architecture for 90 % of our time.
That is enormous.
It means architecture makes us shape in a way that we are not aware of.
That makes us a little naive and very predictable.
i.e. when I show you such a building, I know what you think: you think of 'power','stability' and 'democracy'.
And you think so because it concerns a building built by the Greeks 2 500 years ago.
That is a trick.
These triggers are used by architects to create emotional bonds to the forms we build our buildings from.
It is a predictable emotional bond and we have been using this trick for a very long time.
We used the trick 200 years ago when building banks.
We used it in the 19th century for museum construction.
In the 20th century America, we built houses like this.
Look at these solid, stable little soldiers looking to the ocean and protecting from the weather.
This is very useful, because building things is fearsome.
It is expensive, it takes a long time and it is very complicated.
People who build things -- builders and governments -- are naturally afraid of innovation, and prefer to use the forms that are well received by experience.
This leads to buildings like these.
It is a beautiful building.
But it has little to do with what a library does today.
In the same year, 2004, another library was completed on the other side of the USA and it looks like this.
That is in Seattle.
The library is about media consumption in the digital age.
It is about a new kind of public establishment for the city, a place to gather, read and exchange.
How is it possible, then, that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both libraries, look so differently?
Architecture is based on a kind of pendulum principle.
On the one hand, there is innovation: architects are constantly advancing new technologies, new typologies, new solutions for the way we live today.
We are all black, we become very depressed, you think we are worthy of respect, but we are dead in our minds because we have no choice.
We have to change the page and re-use the symbols you know you love.
If we do that and you are happy, we feel like betrayers, so we are experimenting again, we are swinging the pendulum back and forth, for the last 300 years and certainly for the last 30 years.
Thirty years ago, around the end of the 1970s, the Soviet Union was a very serious threat to the Soviet Union.
architects experimented eagerly with the so-called "brutalism".
It was about concrete.
Small windows, dehumanizing scale.
This is really hard stuff.
As we approached the 1980s, we began to use these symbols again.
We are turning the pendulum back in the opposite direction.
We took the forms you like and updated them.
We added neon and some pastel shades and used new material.
And you loved it.
They did not get enough of it.
We took Chippendale cabinets and transformed them into high houses, which can be medieval castles in glass.
The shapes became big, bold and colourful.
Dwarves became pillars.
It was mad.
But that was the 80s, it was cool.
That was the way it was in postmodernism.
That is how it was with symbols.
They were simple and cheap, because instead of creating places, we created memories of places.
I know, and I know you all know, that this is not Tuscany.
That is Ohio.
At the end of the 80s and early 90s we experimented with so-called "deconstructivism".
We left historical symbols behind us, we relied on new, computer-based design techniques and invented new compositions, forms that clashed with other forms.
It was academic and exciting, it was very unpopular, and we completely annoyed you.
Normally, the pendulum would simply swing back.
But then something surprising happened.
This building was opened in 1997.
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao by Frank Gehry.
This building fundamentally changed the world's relationship with architecture.
According to Paul Goldberger, Bilbao was one of the rare moments when critics, academics and the public were entirely in agreement about the building.
The New York Times called this building a miracle.
Tourism in Bilbao grew by 2 500 % after the construction was completed.
He is our first real star architect.
How is it possible that these forms -- wild and radical -- can spread worldwide?
This happened because the media were successfully caught up and quickly told us that such forms mean culture and tourism.
These forms provoked an emotional reaction in our minds --
as well as for mayors worldwide.
Every mayor knew that these forms brought culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the turn of the millennium also affected some other star architects.
Think about your architectural consumption.
One thousand years ago, you should have gone to the nearest village to see a building.
The transport speed has accelerated: you take a boat, an aeroplane, you travel as a tourist.
Technology accelerated: you see it in newspapers, on TV until we are all architectural photographers and the building is loosened from the plot.
Architecture is now everywhere, i.e. that the speed of communication has finally caught up with the speed of architecture.
Architecture is developing quite quickly.
It does not take long to design a building.
But building a building takes a long time, three to four years, and in the meantime an architect designs two, eight or hundred other buildings before he knows whether the building he designed four years ago was a success or not.
This is due to the lack of a good feedback loop in the architecture.
That is why we have such buildings.
I believe that this will never happen again, because we are on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete, steel or the lift; it is a media revolution.
In my theory, the pendulum rings ever faster when media are used until the two extremes almost strike at the same time, which subsequently blurs the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can create emotionally charged symbols from something completely new almost instantly.
This is evident from a recent project that we have completed.
We were instructed to replace this burnt-out building.
This is the center of a town called Pines on Fire Island in the state of New York.
It is a holiday village.
We were worried, our customers were worried, and the community was worried, so we created a series of photorealistic images that we uploaded to Facebook and on Twitter, letting people do what they do: share, comment, "lik" or hate it.
The paintings were very similar to the final product, so there was no surprise.
This building was already part of this community and in the first summer, when people arrived and started sharing the building in the social media, it was no longer just a building, but became a medium, because these are not just pictures of a building, they are your pictures of a building.
We do not need Greeks to tell us what we should think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media have not only changed the relationship between us, they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think of the librarians in Livingston.
If the building were built today, the first thing they would do today would be to go online and look for "new libraries".
They would be bombarded with experimental, innovative examples that would reach the limit of what a library can be.
That is ammunition.
That is ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor and the citizens of Livingston to tell them that there is not just an answer to what a library is today.
Let us be part of it.
This abundance of experiments gives them the freedom to carry out their own experiment.
Everything has changed.
Architect are no longer mysterious creatures who use big words and complicated drawings, and you are not the sufferers of the public -- the consumer who does not accept anything he has not seen.
You can hear architects, and architecture does not intimidate you.
This is the end of architectural history, which means that the future buildings will look very different from the current buildings.
It means that a public space in the old town of Seville serves the function of a modern city in a unique and individually tailored way.
A Brooklyn stadium can be a Brooklyn stadium, not some historical potpourri of bricks from our ideas of a stadium.
Robots will build our buildings, because we are finally ready for the shapes they will produce.
Buildings will be built to the whim of nature, rather than the other way around.
A car park in Miami Beach, Florida, can also be a place to practice sports or yoga, and even to marry late into the night.
This means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small reindeer pavilion, which is as muscular and powerful as the animals it was designed to observe.
A building does not have to be beautiful to be loved, as in this ugly little building in Spain, where the architects dug a hole, filled it with hay, then poured concrete around it, and when the concrete dried, they asked someone to remove the hay, leaving only this ugly little room, full of scratches and scratches from the production, making it the most sublime place to see a Spanish sunset.
It doesn't matter whether a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings.
It is not important how we build, it is only important what we build.
Architect knows how to design greener, smarter and friendlier buildings.
We have only waited for you to wish it.
At last we are no longer on opposing sides.
Find an architect, commission an architect, design better buildings, better cities and a better world with us, because there is a lot at stake.
Buildings not only reflect our society, they shape it to the smallest places: the city libraries, the home where you bring up your children, and the way they take from their bedroom to their bathroom.
Thank you.
That is my niece, Stella.
She was 1 year old and started to run.
She runs in this cool way, like a 1-year-old runs, a tumble, according to the motto "my body is too fast for my legs".
It looks totally cute.
And one of their favorite occupations is looking at themselves in the mirror.
She loves her reflection very much.
She licks, squeezes and gives herself these large, moist kisses.
When is it suddenly no longer okay to love your appearance?
Because it appears that we are not doing that.
Every month, tens of thousands of people enter Google's 'Am I ugly?'
This is Faye, who lives in Denver, Colorado.
And like every teenager, she wants to be liked and belong.
She is a bit confused, even though her mother tells her that she is beautiful, someone in school tells her every day that she is ugly.
Because her mother says one thing and her friends or school colleagues says another, she doesn’t know whom to believe.
Some of them are so common that you should not think about them.
This is an average, healthy-looking girl who gets this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times of her life.
Well, today’s teenagers are rarely alone.
They are under pressure to be always online and available, they talk, write messages, "liking", comment, share, post -- it never stops.
Never before have we been so connected, so constantly, so promptly, so young.
A mother told me it is like a party in the room every night.
You simply do not have a private life.
And the social pressure that this brings is ruthless.
This always-there-being teaches our children to evaluate themselves on the basis of the number of "likes" and the type of comments they receive.
There is no separation between online and offline life.
It is really hard to say what is real and what is not.
What is their source of inspiration?
You can see the pictures that appear in the newsfeeds of today's girls.
Models with size 0 still dominate the running stages.
Image editing is routine today.
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap, #bikinibridge and #proana.
By the way, #proana stands for Pro-Anarexia.
These trends are linked to the stereotypical and shameless objectiveization of women in the world of work.
It is easy to see who the girls are comparing with.
But the boys are not immune from this either:
The pursuit of the comfy face and washcloth of the heroic athletes and Playboy music stars.
But where is the problem?
Of course, we want our children to become healthy, balanced people.
But in a culture obsessed with appearance, we are educating our children to spend more time and thoughts on appearance, at the expense of all other aspects of their identity.
They start to suffer as a result of their relationships, physical development and school.
6 out of 10 girls prefer not to do anything because they think they don't look good enough.
And these are not insignificant activities.
These are fundamental activities in their development as human beings and as contributors to society and working life.
31%, about one in three teenagers, remain in the classroom during a discussion, and do not participate in it because they do not want to draw attention to their appearance.
One in five does not go to school if they do not feel comfortable with it.
If you think you are not looking good or, above all, not thin enough, you get an average score worse than those who don't have to worry about it.
And that is the case everywhere, in Finland, in the USA.
and China, and no matter how much you actually weigh.
To put it plainly, what is at issue here is how you think you look, not how you actually look.
Negative feeling of body undermines academic success.
But it also damages health.
Teenagers with negative physical feelings do less sport, eat less fruit and vegetables, and often check their weight, which is unhealthy and can lead to eating disorders.
And that simply does not change.
Women who think they are fat - and again, whether they are or not - have longer leaves.
17% of women would not go to an interview if they did not feel comfortable with their appearance on the day.
Think about what that does to the economy.
If we could overcome that, what opportunities this offers us.
It is in the interest of each and every one of us to release this potential.
But how do we do that?
Talking does not take us very far.
That alone is not enough.
If we want to make a difference, we have to do something.
Here are three key factors: first, we must teach them self-esteem.
We must help our young people to develop strategies to overcome image pressure and strengthen self-esteem.
The good news is that there are already many programs.
But the bad news is that most of them do not work.
I was shocked to learn that well-intentioned programmes have unintentionally exacerbated the situation.
We really must ensure that the programmes in which our children participate have not only a positive effect but also a long-term effect.
Research shows that the best programs address 6 key areas: Firstly, the influence of family, friends and relationships.
Secondly, the media and the cult of stars, then the way we deal with gossip and harassment, how we compete with others and compare ourselves by looking, although looking -- some people call this "body talk" or "fat talk" -- and the basis for self-respect and caring for oneself.
i.e. to question how women are currently seen and how they are talked about.
It is not acceptable that we should assess the contribution of our female politicians on the basis of their haircuts, the size of their breasts, or conclude that the success of an Olympic woman depends on her appearance.
We must start to assess them by their actions, not by what they look like.
We can all start to take responsibility for the pictures and comments we post on social networks.
We can compliment people for their success and their actions, not for their appearance.
And I ask you, when did you last kiss a mirror?
We must work together as communities, governments and business partners to move things so that our children appreciate their self-esteem, individuality, diversity and inclusion.
We must put on the podium those who really make a difference so that they make a difference in the world.
We must leave them in the driving seat, because only then will the world change.
A world in which our children have the freedom to become the best version of their self; in which the thoughts about their appearance do not prevent them from being who they really are or achieving what they want.
Think about what this could mean for someone in your life.
A girlfriend or a woman sitting just a little further away.
What would it mean for her if she were freed from this voice, her inner critic, which reproaches her for having longer legs, thinner thighs, a smaller stomach or smaller feet?
What would it mean for them if we overcame this and released their potential?
Today, we are all kept back by our culture’s obsession with appearance.
Let us tell our children the truth.
Let us show them that their appearance is only part of our identity, and that we actually love them for what they are, what they do, and what they give us a feeling.
Self-confidence must be on the curriculum.
Each and every one of us should change the way we talk and compare with others.
Let us work together as communities, from the vocal movement to governments, so that today’s happy 1-year-olds become the self-confident world improvements of tomorrow.
Let us do it.
On 5 November 1990, a man named El-Sayyid Nosair went to a hotel in Manhattan and committed a deadly attack on Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League.
Nosair was initially acquitted of murder, but as he served his sentence for minor offences, he and other men began to plan attacks on a dozen New York landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Fortunately, these plans were thwarted by an FBI intelligence officer.
Sadly, the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 was not fought.
I was born in 1983 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the son of an Egyptian engineer and a loving American and primary school teacher who together did their best to offer me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old did the family dynamics begin to change.
My father showed me a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see.
However, in every religion, in every people, there is a small percentage of people who are so fervent in their faith that they believe they must do everything in their power to get others to live as they do.
We arrived at the Calverton firing station, which was watched by the FBI without our knowledge.
On that day my last ball hit the little orange light over the target and to the surprise of everyone, especially mine, the whole target went up in flames.
This comment seemed to make them all laugh, but only a few years later did I understand what they found so funny about it.
They thought I had the same destructive power as my father.
These men were eventually charged with placing a van with 680 kg of explosives on a lower parking level of the WTC’s North Tower, killing six people and injuring over a thousand others.
I looked at these men.
I called these men "ammu", which means "uncle".
When I was nineteen, we had moved 20 times, and this instability in my childhood gave me little opportunity to make friends.
Once I had established myself somewhere, it was time to pack my suitcases and move to the next city.
As I was always the new pupil in the class, I was often the victim of bullying.
So I spent most of my time at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
Therefore, I lacked communicative skills -- to put it mildly -- and, having grown up in a fanatical household, I was not prepared for the real world.
I was educated to evaluate people according to arbitrary yardsticks, such as their origin or religion.
So what opened my eyes?
One of my first experiences that challenged my thinking was in 2000 during the presidential election.
When I was preparing for college, I was able to attend the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
The focus of my group was youth violence and, as I was a victim of harassment for almost my entire life, this subject aroused strong emotions in me.
The members of our group came from different social strata.
On the penultimate day of the convention, I found out that a boy I had made friends with was a Jew.
It took a few days for this detail to come to light and I realized that there was no natural hostility between us.
I met people of all faiths and cultures there and this experience shaped my personality very strongly.
This feeling enabled me to compare the stereotypes I was taught as a child with encounters in real life situations.
I do not know how it is to be gay, but I do know very well how it is to be condemned for something that goes beyond my control.
Then there was the "Daily Show".
Inspiration often comes from the unexpected, and the fact that a Jewish comedian influenced my worldview more positively than my extremist father did not pass me by.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview began to change, and she said something to me that I will carry in my heart for as long as I live.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of a woman who had experienced dogmatism for her entire life and said, 'I am tired of hating people'.
At that moment I realized how much negative energy it takes to sustain this hatred.
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
I changed it when my family decided to break off contact with my father and start a new life.
So why do I expose myself and possibly put myself at risk?
It is quite simple.
Instead, I use my experience to fight terrorism and fanaticism.
I do so for the victims of terrorism and their families, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has imposed on them in their lives.
On behalf of the victims of terrorism, I am opposed to these senseless acts and condemn the actions of my father.
This simple fact is the living proof that violence is not inherent in a religion or a ethnic group and that the son does not have to follow in the footsteps of the father.
I am not my father.
At this moment a movie is playing in your head.
It is an impressive, multi-track film.
It has 3D with surround sound for all that you are seeing and hearing, but that is just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and touch.
He has a feeling for your body, pain, hunger, orgasms.
It has emotions, anger and joy.
He has memories, for example moments of your childhood, which are being played out in front of you.
And he has a permanent speaker: conscious thinking.
You play the main role in the movie and you can experience all this directly.
The film is your flow of consciousness, the result of how you experience your mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human existence.
Each of us is aware of this.
We all have our own inner movie, you, and you, and you.
There is nothing we can see immediately.
At least I experience my consciousness directly.
I cannot say that you are aware of this.
Our consciousness is also what makes life livable.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would have any meaning or value.
At the same time, it is also the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we not simply robots, which process all the input and generate all the output without even experiencing this inner film?
At this stage, no one knows the answers to these questions.
I claim that some radical ideas will be needed to make scientific progress in the field of consciousness.
Some claim that a science of consciousness is impossible.
Science is objective by nature.
Consciousness is subjective by nature.
Consequently, there can never be a science of consciousness.
This view prevailed for most of the 20th century.
Psychologists examined behavior objectively, neuroscientists examined the brain objectively, and no one even mentioned consciousness.
When TED was founded 30 years ago, there was little scientific work in the field of consciousness.
The change began about 20 years ago.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose have said that the time has come for science to concern itself with consciousness.
Since then, there has been a real explosion, the science of consciousness began to sprout.
This work is great, it is great.
But it still has some fundamental limitations.
We have just seen part of this work from Nancy Kanwisher when she presented her wonderful work.
Now, for example, we understand much better which brain regions are related to the conscious perception of faces, or to the perception of pain or joy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It is not a science of declarations.
We know that these brain regions are associated with certain types of conscious experience, but we do not know why they do so.
I see it as being that this kind of neuroscience findings clarify some of the questions about consciousness that we are seeking answers to -- the question of what certain brain regions do and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, these are the simple problems.
Nothing against neuroscientists.
There are no simple problems with consciousness.
But that does not solve the real mystery, the heart of this issue: why are all the brain’s physical processes accompanied by consciousness at all?
Why does this inner, subjective film exist?
No answer to this question is yet in sight.
Now you may think that we should simply give science another few years.
It will be another emerging phenomenon, such as congestion, hurricanes, life, and we will be able to explain it.
The classic problems of emergence concern all the phenomena of behavior: how congestion occurs, how vertebrates function, how a living organism reproduces, adapts and metabolizes, all questions of the objective functioning.
This could be applied to the human brain by explaining the behaviors and functions of the human brain as emerging phenomena: how we walk, how we speak, how we play chess, all questions of behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, behavioral issues are among the simplest problems.
When it comes to complicated problems, the question arises of why all these behaviors are accompanied by subjective experience.
The standard paradigms of emergence, even the standard paradigms of neuroscience, have not yet said much about this.
As far as science is concerned, I am a materialist in the heart.
For a long time I have been bumbling on granite in my search for a theory of consciousness that is completely physically explicable and works.
I have to admit, however, that this does not work for systematic reasons.
I therefore believe that we have reached a kind of dead end.
We have this wonderful, great chain of explanations, and that is how it is mostly: while physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, and biology explains parts of psychology.
But consciousness does not seem to fit into this model.
On the one hand, there is a certain awareness.
On the other hand, we do not know how we should place this in our scientific worldview.
So I think that consciousness is at the moment a kind of anomaly that we need to integrate into our worldview, but not yet know exactly how.
Faced with such an anomaly, radical ideas could be needed, and I believe we could use one or two ideas that seem mad at first, before we get scientific control of consciousness.
There are a few candidates who are eligible for these crazy ideas.
My friend, Dan Dennett, who is here today, has one of these ideas.
He says there is no difficult problem with consciousness.
The entire concept of the inner subjective film is based on a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, we only have to explain the brain's function objectively, and then we have explained everything that needs to be explained.
I say: just think about it!
This is the kind of radical ideas we need to explore if we are looking for a purely reductionist and brain-based theory of consciousness.
But this view is not satisfactory for me and many others, as it almost denies the existence of human consciousness.
I am therefore moving in a different direction.
In the remaining time, I would like to mention two crazy ideas that I think could be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
Physicists see some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks: space, time, and mass.
They establish fundamental laws based on them, such as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental characteristics and laws are explained by nothing more fundamental.
They are seen as primordial, and the world is built on their foundations.
Sometimes the list of fundamental things is extended.
In the nineteenth century Maxwell discovered that the phenomenon of electromagnetism cannot be explained by existing fundamental things: space, time, mass, Newton's laws. So he established fundamental laws of electromagnetism and explained the electric charge as a fundamental element around which these laws operate.
I believe that we are in the same situation with awareness.
If you cannot explain consciousness using the existing elements -- space, time, mass, charge -- then the logical conclusion is that you must expand the list.
The natural consequence would be to declare consciousness itself as a fundamental element, a fundamental building block of nature.
That does not mean that science cannot be applied with it.
It opens the way for science to be driven by it.
What we then need to explore are the fundamental laws on which consciousness is based, which connect consciousness with other fundamental elements: space, time, mass, physical processes.
Physicists sometimes say that we need fundamental laws that are so simple that they can be printed on the front of a T-shirt.
I believe that we are in such a situation with awareness.
We want to find fundamental laws that are so simple that they can be printed on a t-shirt.
We do not yet know what these laws are, but we are working on them.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness could be universal.
Every system could have a certain kind of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called panpsychism: "pan" stands for everything, "psych" for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even Rob Knight's microbes, elementary particles.
Even every photon has a certain amount of consciousness.
This approach does not say that photons are intelligent or can think.
A photon is not frightened, and thinks: "Ah, I move almost at lightning speed.
I can never stop and rest.'
No, not so.
But the idea is that photons may have a certain kind of raw, subjective feeling, a kind of primitive forerunner of consciousness.
That may sound a little idiotic to you.
I think why should anyone think something so crazy?
Part of this is based on the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental.
If it is fundamental, as space, time and mass, it is to be expected that it could also be universal, as they are.
It must also be said that this idea, which seems absurd to us, is far less absurd for people of other cultures, in cultures that see the human spirit in closer harmony with nature.
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and best way to find the fundamental laws between consciousness and physical processing is to connect consciousness with information.
Wherever there is information processing, there is consciousness.
Complex information processing, as in humans -- complex consciousness.
Simple information processing -- simple consciousness.
What is exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi, has consistently developed the approach of this theory with a mathematical theory.
He uses mathematical measure of information integration, called "Phi", to measure the amount of information in a system.
And he suspects that Phi is connected with consciousness.
In the human brain, an inconceivable amount of information integration, a high level of phi, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse, middle amount of information integration, still very high -- significant level of consciousness.
But if we go further on worms, microbes, particles, phi decreases sharply.
Information integration is falling, but it is still larger than zero.
According to Tononi's theory, there will still be consciousness that is absolutely zero.
In fact, he proposes a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
I do not know whether this theory is right, but it could be the current leading theory in the science of consciousness, and it served to link a whole series of scientific data, and it is simple enough to print it on the front of a T-shirt.
Another final reason is that panpsychism could help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a series of formulae, but it does not tell us about the reality underlying it.
As Stephen Hawking says, 'What gives life to formulae?'
In the view of Panpsychism, one can leave the formulae of physics as they are, but one can use them to explain the flow of consciousness.
That is what physics ultimately does to explain the flow of consciousness.
Consequently, it is consciousness that breathes life into formulae.
From this perspective, consciousness does not hover outside the physical world as a kind of extra.
It is located right in their centre.
I believe that this pan-psychic view has the potential to change our relationship with nature in the long term, and that this could have some serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of them may not be intuitive.
I used to think I should not eat anything that has a consciousness, and therefore be a vegetarian.
If you take the pan-psychic view, you will be very hungry.
I think that if we think about this, it could change our perspective, whereas what is important from an ethical and moral point of view is not so much the existence of consciousness as the extent and complexity of consciousness.
It is also logical to ask about consciousness in other systems, such as computers.
What about the artificial intelligent system in the movie "Her", Samantha?
Is it aware?
If you are advocating the informational, pan-psychic view, you certainly have a high level of information processing and integration, so the answer should be yes, it is aware.
If that is right, serious ethical issues arise, both on the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and on the ethics of shutting them down.
Finally, one might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, of the planet.
Does Canada Have a Consciousness of its own?
Or at local level, does a united group, like the audience of a TED conference, have a collective TED consciousness; is there an inner film for this collective TED group that is different from the inner films of each individual?
I do not know the answer to this question, but I think it should at least be asked.
Well, this vision of panpsychism is radical and I do not know whether it is right.
I am actually more convinced by the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental than by the second that it is universal.
This view raises many questions, holds many challenges, such as how the individual parts of consciousness interact and create this complexity of consciousness that we know and love.
If we can find answers to these questions, we will be on the right track towards a serious theory of consciousness.
If not, then this may be the most complicated problem in science and philosophy.
We cannot expect to solve it overnight.
But I believe that we will ultimately solve it.
I believe that understanding our consciousness is both a key to understanding the universe and understanding ourselves.
It might just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a very small town in Victoria.
My childhood was normal and unobtrusive.
I went to school, hang out with friends, argued with my younger sisters.
It was very comfortable and clean.
When I was 15 years old, a community member spoke to my parents: the community wanted to nominate me for a special achievement award.
My parents said, 'Well, that's really very nice, but there is an obvious problem:
To be honest, it has not yet achieved anything'. And they were right.
I went to school, got good marks, helped out after school at my mother's hairdresser's and spent a lot of time watching "Buffy – In the spell of the demons" and "Dawson's Creek".
Yes, I know, but what a contradiction.
But they were right.
Years later, while I was teaching at a high school in Melbourne, after 20 minutes of law lessons, a boy asked, 'When do you start your speech?'
'What speech?' I wanted to know.
I had spoken for 20 minutes about libel and ill-treatment.
He said: 'Well, you know, well, your motivational speech.
When someone comes here in a wheelchair, that person usually tells some inspiring stuff.'
'Normally, it is in the chamber'.
I was struck by a light: this boy had known people with disabilities until now only as objects of inspiration.
For him we are that... and for him nothing can be done, it is true for many.
For many people, disabled people are not teachers, doctors or nail dressers.
We are not real people, we are supposed to inspire.
And in fact I sit here on this stage and look like I do in a wheelchair and you probably expect somehow from me to inspire you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must absolutely disappoint you.
I am not here to inspire you.
I will tell you that we have been lied about when it comes to disability.
Disability is not a bad thing and it does not make us exceptional.
In recent years, we have even been able to spread this lie even further in the social media.
You probably saw images like this: 'The only disability in life is a bad attitude'.
Or: 'Your excuse is hindered'.
Or, 'Before you give up, be strict!'
These are just a few examples; there are many such pictures circulating.
You may know the story of the little girl without hands painting a picture with a pen in her mouth.
You may have seen the child walking on carbon prostheses.
And these pictures, there are many, we call inspiration pornography.
I use the word pornography deliberately, because people are being turned into objects to benefit others.
Disabled people are being made objects so that non-disabled people can benefit.
Such pictures are designed to inspire, motivate, so that people look at the disabled and think: "How bad my life is, it could be worse.
I could be that man'.
But what if you are that man?
I stopped counting how many times strangers approached me to say that they thought I was brave or inspiring, long before my work became publicly known.
In a way, I was congratulated that I could get up in the morning and remember my name, so that a person is made into an object.
All these pictures turn disabled people into objects, for the benefit of the non-disabled.
Disabled people are there to see them, to feel better about themselves and to put their concerns into perspective.
Living with a disability is indeed quite difficult.
We are coping with a lot of things.
But what we are doing is not what you suspect.
It has nothing to do with our body.
I deliberately use the term disability because I support the social model of disability, which is a society in which we are disabled rather than our bodies and diagnoses.
I have long been living in this body.
I really like it.
He does what is necessary, and I have learned to make the best use of his skills, just as you do, and that is what the children on these photos are about:
They are not doing anything extraordinary.
They simply use their bodies as much as they can.
Is it really fair how they are made into objects and how these photos are shared?
When people say "you are an inspiration", they want to make a compliment.
I know why.
Because of the lie that has been told us: that disability makes exceptional.
I say sarcastic things about inspiration and you think: 'Man, Stella, never anything inspires you?'
Yes, yes.
I am constantly learning from other disabled people.
However, I do not learn that I was more fortunate than they.
I learn that it is a great idea to lift things down with a barbecue plier, and I learn the ingenious trick of charging the mobile phone with the battery of the wheelchair.
Genial!
We learn from the strength and endurance of others, not in the fight against our bodies and diagnoses, but against a world that makes us special objects.
In my opinion, this lie about disability is a glaring injustice.
It makes life difficult for us.
And the quotation 'the only disability in life is a bad attitude' is great madness because that is not true because of the social model of disability.
You can smile at the stairs for a long time, but they don't turn into a ramp.
That will never happen.
I want to live in a world where disability is the norm,
where a 15-year-old girl looking in her room at "Buffy – In the spell of demons" is not considered a success man just because she is sitting;
I want to live in a world where not so many people expect disabled people to get up and remember their names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where real achievement by disabled people is appreciated; I want to live in a world where a 11th-grade student in Melbourne is not surprised that his new teacher is in a wheelchair.
It is not disability that makes us exceptional, but rather the questioning of our attitude to it.
Thank you.
What does "Enhanced Reality" and professional football have to do with empathy?
How fast is an "unloaded" swallow travelling in the air?
Unfortunately, I will only answer one of these questions today, so please do not be too disappointed.
Most people think of "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise as he hovers in the air, but ER is not science fiction.
It is something that comes sooner than we think, even in our lifetime, and it will come because we have the necessary technologies, and we must be aware of it, because it will change our lives, just like the Internet and the mobile phone.
And how do we get the ER?
I am taking the first step towards success: Google Glass.
Many of you probably know Google Glass.
You may not know that Google Glass is a device that allows you to see what I see.
And to experience what it is like to be a professional on the field.
At the moment you can only experience it if I describe it to you.
I must put it into words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
With Google Glass we can put it under a helmet and get a feeling of how it is to run with 160 things over the field and feel your heartbeat on your whole body.
You can see how it is when a 125-kilo man jumps on you and tries to behave with his full body.
I have experienced it myself and it does not feel good.
Here is the video.
Let us go.
Aah, being shackled is corrosive.
Moment, I will get closer.
Are you ready?
Get on with it!
You will have noticed that there are people missing: the rest of the team.
We have a video of it from the University of Washington.
Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54!
Blue 8! Blue 8!
Oh!
Fans want this experience,
would like to be on the field.
They want to be your favorite players and have already asked me on YouTube and Twitter: "Can you give that to a quarterback?
Once we have the experience with GoPro and Google Glass, how do we do it better?
What is the next step?
The Oculus Rift is considered to be one of the most realistic VR devices of all time, and that is not just a hype.
And I can show you why this is so with this video.
Oh! Oh!
No, no, no, I do not want to go any further!
Oh my God!
A man is a rollercoaster rider and fears for his life.
How will it be for him when he runs down the mountain as a skier at Olympia at over 100 km/h?
I believe that adults will wear diapers again.
But that is not yet an ER.
This is only virtual reality.
How do we get to the ER?
We do this when coaches, managers and owners evaluate this information and ask themselves: "How do we improve our team?
How can we win games with it?"
Teams use technologies to win games.
You like to win, that brings money.
A short history of technologies in the NFL.
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts gave their quarterback a bracelet that allowed him to announce moves faster.
They won the SuperBowl.
Other teams followed suit.
More people watched, because the Games were going on.
were more exciting and faster.
In 1994, the NFL equipped quarterback helmets with radios, and later defender helmets.
More people watched, the games were moving faster.
and more entertaining.
Imagine in 2023 you are playing the game, you walk back to the huddle and you see the next game in front of you on your plastic badge, which you already wear today.
No longer fear for forgotten moves.
No longer fear of having to learn all the tactics.
You go out and react.
And the coaches want that, because missed instructions causes a game to be lost, and coaches don't like to lose.
Then they will be fired.
They do not want that.
But ER is not just an improved gameplay guide.
It also allows you to use all of these data in real-time to improve your game.
What would that look like?
A very simple device would be a camera at every corner of the stadium which would show all people below from a bird's eye view.
You also have the data from the helmets and the accelerometers, technologies that are currently being worked on.
You collect all this information for your players.
The good teams deliver usable data,
the bad ones deliver a flood of data.
That is what distinguishes good teams from bad ones.
And now your IT department is as important as your scouting, and data gathering is no longer just for nerds.
Who would have thought of this?
What would that look like in the field?
Imagine you are a quarterback.
You get the ball.
You are looking for a free fellow player.
Suddenly a lightning bolt appears on your visor on the left and shows you that the Blind Side Linebacker is starting.
Normally you don't see him, but the ER will tell the player about that.
You are going into position.
Another flash for a player.
They throw but are hit.
The ball is out of control,
You do not know where it will end up.
But the receiver's sight makes the spot mark and it can react.
He can catch the ball, runs off, touchdown.
The crowd is buzzing, and the fans are always with him, and from every perspective.
This will generate a new enthusiasm for the game.
People will be watching in crowds, because they want this experience.
Fans want to be in the field.
Want to be your favorite player.
It becomes part of sport, because it is not worth not doing it.
But my question to you is: are we satisfied with using ER only for that?
Do we want to use it only for bread and games, normal entertainment?
I believe that we can use ER for more.
I believe we can use the ER to promote empathy in people by showing someone how it is to fit into someone else.
We know what this technology is worth to the sports leagues.
They invest billions of euros each year.
What is this technology worth to a gay man in Uganda or Russia who wants to show the world the conditions under which he lives?
What is this technology worth to Commander Hadfield or Neil deGrasse Tyson, who want to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science, rather than about quarterly reports and the Kardashians?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Extended Reality will come.
The questions we ask, the decisions we make, the challenges we face are, as always, entirely in our hands.
Thank you very much.
I recently retired from the California traffic guard after 23 years.
Most of these 23 years I spent as a patrolman at the southern tip of Marin County, where the Golden Gate Bridge is also located.
The bridge is an iconic building known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architecture.
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide, because it is one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in 1937.
Joseph Strauss, the leading engineer, is quoted as saying: "The bridge is almost suicidal.
To commit suicide on the bridge is neither practical nor likely."
Since its opening, however, more than 1 600 people have fallen to death from this bridge.
Some believe that moving between the two towers leads one into another dimension -- the bridge has been romanticized so much -- that falling away frees one from all worries and all pain, and the water below washes one's soul.
I will tell you what really happens when the bridge is used as a means of suicide.
In the event of a collision, the bones fragment, some of which break through vital organs.
Most die in the crash.
Those who do not die usually row helplessly in the water and then drown.
I do not think that those who consider this type of suicide understand what a terrible death they face.
This is the cable.
Except for the area around the two towers, 80 cm of steel is running next to the bridge.
Most people are standing here before taking their lives.
From experience, I can tell you that a person who is already on the cable, and at the darkest hour of the day, is very difficult to get back.
I took this photo last year when this young woman spoke to a policeman and thought about her life.
I am very glad to tell you that we were successful on that day in getting them to the other side of the fence.
When I started working on the bridge, there was no official training.
You have tried to find your way through all the calls.
This was a disservice not only to potential suicides, but also to the police.
Since then, we have come a long way.
Today, former policemen and psychologists train the new policemen.
That is Jason Garber.
I met Jason last year on 22 July when I received a call about a potentially suicidal person sitting on the cable roughly in the middle of the bridge.
I replied and when I arrived I watched Jason talking to a Golden Gate Bridge policeman.
Jason was just 32 years old and flew here from New Jersey.
After talking to Jason for about an hour, he asked us whether we knew the story of Pandora.
We remember the Greek mythology: Zeus created Pandora and sent her to the earth, along with a book, and said to her: 'Never open, never open this book'.
And one day, when curiosity defeated Pandora, she opened the bookcase.
The result was epidemics, suffering and all kinds of evils spreading through mankind.
The only good thing in the book was hope.
Then Jason asked us, 'What happens when you open the box and there is no hope in it?'
He was silent for a moment, leaned to the right and left.
This nice intelligent young man from New Jersey had just taken his life.
I spoke to Jason's parents that evening and I think when I spoke to them I didn't sound very good because the next day the rabbi of the family called me to ask me about me.
Jason's parents asked him to do so.
The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people.
I ask you the following questions: what would you do if a family member, a friend or a beloved person were at risk of suicide?
What would you say?
Would you know what you are supposed to say?
In my experience, it is not just about talking to each other, but about listening.
To listen to understand.
Do not discuss, do not make accusations, or tell the other person you know how they feel, because you probably do not know.
Simply being there, you are perhaps the turning point that the person needed.
If you think that someone is at risk of suicide, you are not afraid to confront that person.
You could ask, for example, 'Other people in similar situations have thought about ending their lives; did you have such thoughts?'
Faced with it, it may save the person’s life and bring a turning point for them.
Other signs you should be aware of are hopelessness, belief that things are going badly and never get better; helplessness, belief that nothing can be done about it; recent withdrawal from social life and loss of a general interest in life.
I thought up this talk only a few days ago and I received an email from a lady who I would like to read out to you.
She lost her son on 19 January this year and she wrote this email to me only a few days earlier and, with her permission and blessing, I am reading it to you.
"Hi Kevin, you are probably at the TED conference.
It must be a great experience there.
I think I should go for a walk on the bridge this weekend.
I wanted to send you a few lines.
I hope that you will reach many people with your message and that they will go home and talk about it with their friends, who will also tell their friends about it, etc.
I am still quite stunned, but I have more and more moments when I realize that Mike is not going home anymore.
Mike went from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the 49ers' match with his father on January 19.
He never got there.
I called the police in Petaluma and reported him as missing that evening.
The next morning two policemen came to my home and told me that Mike's car was standing at the bridge.
A witness saw him jump from the bridge the day before at 1:58 p.m.
I am so grateful to you for standing up for those who are perhaps too weak at times to be strong for themselves.
Who hasn’t been ill without being mentally ill?
It should not be so easy to end one’s own life.
I pray for you and the fight you are fighting.
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge, should be a transition over our beautiful bay, not a graveyard.
Good luck this week, Vicky."
I cannot imagine how much courage it has taken her to go to the bridge and go the way her son took that day, nor how much courage it needs to continue.
I would like to present to you a man who represents hope and courage for me.
On 11 March 2005, I reacted to a report about a person at risk of suicide near the North Tower.
I went on the path with my motorcycle and watched this young man, Kevin Berthia, standing on the path.
For the next hour and a half I heard Kevin talk about his depression and hopelessness.
On the day, Kevin decided alone to climb again over the barrier and give his life another chance.
When Kevin knocked back, I congratulated him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him: 'What exactly led you to climb over the banister again and give hope and life another chance?'
And do you know what he told me?
He said: 'You have listened to me.
You let me speak and you only listened to me.'
Shortly after that event I got a letter from Kevin's mother and I have it here and I would like to read it out to you.
"Dear Mr Briggs, nothing can reverse the events of 11 March, but you are one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
I firmly believe that Kevin sought help.
He was diagnosed with a mental illness for which he received the appropriate medicine.
I adopted Kevin at just six months old, completely unaware of any inheritance, but thank God we know now.
Kevin is doing well, as he says.
We thank God for you.
Deep in your debt, Narvella Berthia'.
And in the end she writes: "P.S. When I visited the San Francisco hospital that evening, you were registered as a patient.
Young, I had to pull that straight.'
Today Kevin is a loving father and a contributing member of the society.
He openly talks about what happened that day and his depression in the hope that his story inspires others.
I have not only met suicide in my work.
Also in a personal environment.
My grandfather died from poisoning.
This act, even though it has ended his own pain, has deprived me of the opportunity to ever know him.
That is suicide.
Most people at risk of suicide or those who think about suicide would never think of hurting another person.
They just want their own pain to stop.
This usually happens in one of three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
In my career, I responded to hundreds of calls and was involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide around the bridge.
In the incidents in which I was directly involved, I lost only two people, but that is two too many.
One of them was Jason.
The other was a man with whom I spoke for about an hour.
He shaken my hand three times.
He looked at me at the last handshake and said, 'Kevin, I am sorry, but I have to go'.
And he jumped.
I would nevertheless like to tell you that most of the people we meet on the bridge are not committing suicide.
Moreover, most of the people who jumped and survived and were able to talk about it, those one or two per cent, these people said that the moment they took off they knew that they had made a mistake and that they wanted to live.
I tell people that the bridge not only connects Marin and San Francisco, but also connects people.
The connection, or bridge, we are making is something that each and every one of us should strive for.
Suicide is avoidable.
There is help, there is hope.
Thank you.
The world makes you something you are not, but deep inside you you know what you are, and the question burns in your heart: "How will you become that?"
I may be a little special, but I am not alone, absolutely not alone.
When I became a model, it was as if the dream I had since childhood had finally come true.
My external self finally agreed with my inner truth, my inner self.
The reasons for this are many -- I will come back to this later -- but when I saw this picture, I felt like: 'Geena, this is it!
But last October I realised that I was only at the beginning.
We are all being put in drawers by our families, by our religion, by our society, by the time we are living in, even by our own bodies.
Some people have the courage to free themselves, not to accept the restrictions imposed by their colour or the belief of their fellow human beings.
These people are always a threat to the status quo, to what is considered acceptable.
In my case, for the last nine years, some of my neighbours, some of my friends, even my agent, have not known about my story.
When I was five years old, I always wore this t-shirt on my head at home in the Philippines.
My mother asked me, 'Why do you always wear this t-shirt on your head?'
I said,'Mom, these are my hairs, I'm a girl'.
I knew my own identity at that time.
Gender has always been considered a fact, unchangeable, but today we know that it is fluid, complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never had the courage to tell my story, not because I thought something was wrong with me, but because of the way the world treats those of us who want to free themselves.
Every day I am so grateful because I am a woman.
I have a mother, a father and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
In Asia, there is an old tradition that praises gender as a fluid mystery.
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu deity, a Hjira deity [with third sex].
When I was eight years old, I was at a fiesta in the Philippines to celebrate these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I still remember that this beautiful woman came out, right in front of me, and at that moment I knew: this kind of woman was what I wanted to be.
When I was 15 years old, still dressed as a boy, I met a woman called T.L.
She was a manager of transgender beauty contests.
That evening she asked me: 'Why don't you participate in the beauty contest?'
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I found myself in the world of beauty contests.
Not many people were in the first job beauty queen in recruitment for transgender women, but I like it.
At the age of between 15 and 17 I participated in the most prestigious contests, and those that were literally held behind the truck, or sometimes the walkway next to a rice field, and when it was raining -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers had to put everything in some house.
I also experienced the kindness of strangers, especially when traveling to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But most importantly, I found some of my best friends in this community.
In 2001, my mother from San Francisco called me and told me that my application for a green card had been approved and that I could now move to the US.
I opposed it.
I said to her, "Mom, I'm having fun.
I am here with friends, I love to travel and be a beauty queen.
Two weeks later she called again and said,'Did you know that you can change your name and gender when you move to the US?'
I did not need to hear any more.
My mother also said I should write my name with two "E".
She also accompanied me when I had my operation in Thailand at the age of 19.
It is interesting that some of the most respected, safest and most demanding operations are performed in the most rural areas of Thailand.
Back then, in the US, it was necessary to have surgery before changing a name or gender.
In 2001, I moved to San Francisco, and I still remember when I saw my California driving licence, which was called Geena and had the gender F.
It was an impressive moment.
For some people, this card is a licence to drive cars, or to buy alcohol, but for me it was my licence to live and feel dignity.
I thought I could realize my dream, move to New York and become a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I am thinking of a woman called Ayla Nettles.
She is from New York, a young woman who bravely lived her truth, but hatred put an end to her life.
For most of those who come from my background, this is the reality in which we live.
Our suicide rate is nine times that of the general population.
Every year on 20 November we hold a worldwide celebration of Transgender Day of Remembrance.
I am here on this stage because there is a long history of people who rose up and fought against injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
Today, at this very moment, my real outing is happening.
I could no longer live my truth for myself.
I want to do my best to help others to live their truth without shame and fear.
I am exposing myself here so that one day there will be no need to hold a commemoration on 20 November.
My inner truth allowed me to accept myself as I am.
Can you do that too?
Thank you.
I would like to know what you would say, especially to parents, but also in broad terms to friends, to families and to those who meet children or people who have difficulties with the gender that is allocated to them, what could you say to the family members of those people, which helps them to be good, caring and compassionate family members?
I am very lucky.
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so -- it's just that gender identity is at the heart of our being, is it?
We are all allocated a gender when we are born, and I am trying to have a conversation about the fact that the allocated gender sometimes does not fit, and that people should be given room to find their own identity, and that is the conversation we should have, with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement is still at its very beginning, compared to the beginnings of the lesbian and gay movement.
There is still a great deal to be done.
There should be transparency.
There should be room for curiosity, for questions, and I hope that all of you here are my allies in this.
Thank you very much, it was wonderful.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, fathers are usually known by their sons, but I am one of the few fathers known by their daughter, and I am proud of that.
Before that she was my daughter, but now I am her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, when we look at the history of mankind, the history of women is a history of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation.
She is not welcomed, neither by her father nor by her mother.
The neighbours come to mourn the mother and no one congratulates the father.
A mother feels very uneasy when she has a girl.
When she brings up the first girl, the first daughter, she is sad.
When she brings up her second daughter, she is shocked and, while waiting for a son, when the third daughter is born, she feels guilty like a criminal.
It is not only the mother who suffers, but also the daughter, the newborn daughter, because when she grows older she also suffers.
At the age of five, at the age she should go to school, she stays at home while her brothers are taken into school.
Until the age of 12 she has somehow a good life.
It can be fun.
She can play with her friends on the street and move freely there like a butterfly.
But as a young girl, at the age of 13, she is forbidden to go out of school without male accompaniment.
She is locked up in the four walls of her own home.
She is no longer a free person.
She is being given the so-called honour of her father, her brothers and her family, and if she violates the so-called code of honour, she can even be killed.
It is also interesting that this so-called code of honour affects not only the life of the girl herself, but also the lives of the male family members.
I know of a family of seven sisters and one brother, and that one brother has emigrated to the Gulf States to make a living for his seven sisters and his parents because he thinks it is humiliating for his seven sisters to go to work and go out of school to make a living.
This brother, therefore, sacrifices the joy in his life and the happiness of his sisters on the altar of so-called honor.
There is another important norm of patriarchal societies, and that is obedience.
A good girl must be very quiet, very modest and very submissive.
That is the yardstick of judgment.
The model good girl must be very quiet.
She should be very silent and she should accept the decisions of her father and mother, and the decisions of the elderly, even if she does not like them.
Otherwise, it will be called disobedient.
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a poet, she is married and wed to bring up further sons and daughters.
And this vicious circle is continuing.
Ladies and gentlemen, this plight of millions of women could be changed if we thought differently, if women and men thought differently, if men and women in patriarchal societies and tribal societies in developing countries could abolish some of the rules that apply to families and society, if they could abolish the discriminatory laws that in their systems violate the fundamental human rights of women.
Dear Brothers and Sisters, when Malala was born, when I first looked her in the eye, believe me, I do not like newborns, quite honestly.
Long before she was born, I thought about her name, and was fascinated by the heroic, legendary Afghan freedom fighter.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand and I named my daughter after her.
A few days after Malala's birth, after the birth of my daughter, my cousin came by -- and it was purely by chance -- he came to my home and brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at that tree, it went back 300 years to our ancestors.
And when I looked at him like this -- all of them were men -- I took my pen, pulled a line from my name and wrote "Malala" there.
When she became older, at four and a half years of age, I took her into my school.
Well, you certainly ask why should I mention a girl being admitted to school?
Yes, I must mention it.
This may be taken for granted in Canada, the USA and many other developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it is a great event for the life of a girl.
Going to school means recognizing their identity and their name.
Going to school means entering the world of her dreams and hopes, where she can explore her talents for her future life.
I have five sisters and none of them could go to school, and you will be surprised to learn that two weeks ago, when I filled in the form for the Canadian visa and answered the section on the family, I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters on any document.
What my father could not give to my sisters, his own daughters, I felt I had to change.
I have always appreciated the intelligence and brilliance of my daughter.
I encouraged them to sit with me when my friends came to visit me.
I encouraged them to attend different meetings with me.
And all these good values I tried to anchor in her personality.
And that was not just for them, not just for Malala.
I shared these good values in my school, both with pupils and with students.
I used education for emancipation.
I taught my girls, I taught my pupils to learn the lesson of obedience.
I taught my students to learn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honour.
Dear brothers and sisters, we sought more rights for women and we fought to preserve more, more and more space for women in society.
But we have stumbled across a new phenomenon.
Something fatal for human rights, and particularly for women's rights.
It is called Talibanisation.
This is a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools have been lost.
Girls were forbidden to go to school.
Women were forced to wear veils and were prevented from going to markets.
Musicians were silenced, girls were beaten and singers were killed.
Millions have suffered, but few have spoken out, and it is very frightening to defend one's rights when one is surrounded by people who are breaking and killing.
It is really the most frightening thing.
At the age of 10, Malala rose up and stood up for her right to education.
She wrote a diary for a BBC blog, worked volunteers for the New York Times documentary, and spoke on every possible stage.
And their voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a "Crescendo" everywhere in the world.
And that was why the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign, which was shot at her head from a very short distance on 9 October 2012.
It was the day of the Last Judgment for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
As my daughter was floating between life and death, I whispered to my wife: 'Am I guilty of what happened to my daughter and your daughter?'
And she immediately replied: "Please do not blame you.
You are acknowledged for the right thing.
You put your life at risk for truth, for peace, and for education, and your daughter was inspired by you and followed you.
You are both on the right track and God will protect you.'
These few words meant a great deal and I did not ask the question again.
While Malala was in hospital suffering severe pain, severe headache because her facial nerve was cut, I saw a dark shadow spreading on my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained.
She always said to us: "My shallow smile is fine, and my deafness in the face is fine.
I will be well, please do not worry'.
She was a comfort for us and she gave us a favour.
Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her resilience in the most difficult times and I am glad to share it with you.
It cries when its homework is not complete.
She is arguing with her brothers, which I am very happy about.
People ask me what is special about me as a mentor, what Malala has done so bravely, and so courageously, so vocally and so sovereignly.
And I say unto them, do not ask me what I have done.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not put their wings on the ground, that is all.
Thank you very much.
I was surgery on the brain 18 years ago and brain research has become a passion for me ever since.
I am an engineer.
Anyway, after brain surgery, you get a stigma.
Is I still intelligent or not?
And if not, can I become it again?
Immediately after my operation, I had to determine how much of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals I would take every day, and if I had not taken anything, I would have died within hours.
Some times it was really close.
Fortunately, I love experimentation through and through, so I decided to experiment to find better doses, because there is really no road map in this area that is detailed enough.
I tried different mixes and it absolutely took me out of my mind how small changes in doses can change my self-esteem, my sense of myself, my thinking, my behaviour towards other people.
One particularly dramatic case: for several months I actually took doses and chemicals typical of a man in the early 20s and I couldn’t believe how my thoughts changed.
I was quite extreme.
But I was surprised that I did not try to be arrogant.
I tried, a little unsure and afraid, to solve the problem before me, and it simply didn't work.
But I believe that, thanks to this experience, I have a better understanding of men and of what they have to go through, and since then I have been able to deal with men much better.
I wanted to achieve one thing with the coordination of these hormones and neurotransmitters and so on: after my illness and operation I wanted to regain my intelligence, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think mainly in images and so this became the key question for me -- how do I get these mental images that I use as a kind of quick rapid prototyping for my ideas, if you like, to test different ideas to play through different scenarios.
This is not a new way of thinking.
Philosophers like Hume, Descartes, and Hobbes saw it similarly.
They thought that pictures and ideas were actually the same thing.
Today many people dispute this and how our brain actually works is a heated debate, but for me it is quite simple: mental images, for most of us, are essential for inventive and creative thinking.
So, after several years I finally agreed and now I see many great, very lively mental images with a high level and the necessary analytical basis.
Now I am working on how to get these mental images from my head to my computer faster.
Imagine if a film director were able to direct the world only with his imagination.
Or a musician could bring his music out of his head.
This offers incredible opportunities for creative people to communicate at lightning speed.
I would like to show you why I think we are close to it: here are two recent experiments by two of the most outstanding groups in neuroscience.
Both used fMRI technology -- functional magnetic resonance imaging -- to map the brain, and here you see a brain scan set by Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues in Harvard.
The left column shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows a brain scan of the same person who only imagines to see the image.
And the right column was created by subtracting the middle from the left column and shows that the difference is almost zero.
This was repeated by many different people, with many different pictures, always with a similar result.
There is almost no difference between actually looking at the image and thinking of seeing the same image.
Next, let me show you another experiment, that of Jack Gallant Laboratories at Cal Berkeley.
In this experiment, people were played hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while brain scans were made, creating a comprehensive collection of data that shows the participants’ reactions to the video sequences.
Then a new film was shown, with new pictures, new people, new animals, and a new series of scans was recorded.
The computer, using only the brain scan data, decoded the new brainscans and showed what he thought the person actually saw.
On the right side you see the computer attempt and on the left side the preplayed clip.
That leaves you without the language.
We are so close to it.
We only need to improve resolution.
And don’t forget that when you see an image and imagine seeing the same image, the brain scan will produce almost exactly the same result.
This was done with the highest resolution of today's brain scanning systems, and resolution has really improved thousands of times over the last few years.
Next, we need to improve resolution a thousand times to get deeper insights.
How do we do that?
There are many different methods for this approach.
One way would be to break the skull and insert electrodes.
That is not for me.
Many new imaging techniques are proposed, some of them even by me, but in the light of the recent successes with MRI, we must first ask ourselves whether we have reached the end of this technology.
Conventional experience suggests that resolution can only be increased by using larger magnets, but at this point, larger magnets only improve resolution gradually, not thousandfold as we need them.
I propose that we need better magnets instead of bigger magnets.
We can design much more complicated structures with slightly different combinations, a little like a spirograph.
So why is that important?
In recent years, MRI technology has been seeking to produce huge, really huge magnets.
But most of the recent advances in resolution came actually from the ingenious encryption and decryption in UWB radio frequency transmitters and receivers in MRI systems.
So we should also add structured magnetic patterns to the radio frequencies of the U.K.W.
Thus, by combining these magnetic patterns with the radio frequency patterns of the UHF radio, we can extract much more information from a single scan.
When using fMRI, we should be able to measure not only the flow of oxygen-rich blood, but also hormones and neurotransmitters, as mentioned earlier, and perhaps even direct nerve activity, which is the goal.
We will be able to upload our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine skipping language and communicating directly with human thoughts?
What would we then be able to do?
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought?
You think the Internet is big.
These are enormous questions.
It could be irresistible as an instrument that enhances our thinking and communication skills.
And this instrument could genuinely lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have almost no choice but to open this door.
It is hard to imagine that it will take even longer.
We must learn to take this step together.
Thank you.
I think we are all being ashamed.
Your outing can be to tell someone for the first time that you love her, or to tell someone that you are pregnant, or to tell someone that you have cancer, or one of the other difficult conversations we have in our lives.
The conversation after the outing is always difficult, and although the subjects can be very different, the experience of having a secret and being out is universal.
It is frightening and we hate it, but it must be done.
Several years ago I worked at the Walnut Cafe on the South Side, a snack in the city, and during my time there I went through phases of militant lesbian strength: no shave of the ax, quoting lyrics by Ani DiFranco as principles.
And depending on how "baggy" my trousers were and how short my hair was, the question I often got asked, usually from a small child, was: "Oh, are you a boy or a girl?"
And then there was an unpleasant silence at the table.
I tightened my teeth a little, held my coffee cup with a little more vehemence.
The father moved his newspaper, and the mother turned a cool look at her child.
But I didn’t say anything and I cooked internally.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have this difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks it happened again.
"Are you a boy or a girl?"
I have quotations from Gloria Steinem.
I even prepared a small excerpt from "The Vagina Monographs".
So I breathe deep, look down and a 4-year-old girl in a pink dress looks at me, no challenge to a feminist duel, just a child asking: 'Are you a boy or a girl?'
So I breathe deeper, I hover next to them and say: "Hey, I know it's a bit confusing.
My hair is as short as a boy's and I wear boys' clothes, but I am a girl, and do you know how you sometimes like to wear a pink dress and how you sometimes prefer to wear your comfortable sleeping suit?
So I'm more of the comfortable sling girl type.'
And this child looks me directly in the eyes, without blinking, and says: "My favourite sleepsuit is purple with fish.
Can I have a pancake please?"
How about a pancake?"
This was the easiest and most difficult conversation I have ever had.
Why? Because the pancake girl and I were honest with each other.
Like many of us, I had some secrets in my life and yes, most of the time it was about being gay.
But people are not being looked at for the secrets they carry around.
You only know how it feels to have a secret.
My secret is therefore no different from yours or yours or yours.
I can give you 100 reasons why my outing was harder than yours, but the point is: hard is not relative.
Hard is hard.
Who says it is harder to explain to someone that you have just filed for insolvency than to explain to someone that you have just defrauded them?
Who says that his or her coming-out story is more difficult than telling your 5-year-old child that you are going to get divorced?
There is no harder, there is only hard.
We must stop comparing our own difficulties with those of others just to feel better or worse about our secrets; instead, we should have compassion because we all have difficulties.
At a certain point in our lives we have all the secrets and they may give us security, or at least more security than what might happen if we reveal them.
But I am here to tell you that, whatever your secret, you should not carry it around.
I wore a horsetail, a sleeveless dress and heeled shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian who was ready to fight every four-year-old who came into the café.
I was frozen by fear, rolled up in the corner, with my dark secret and clinging my gay grenades, and moving a muscle is the most frightening thing I had ever done.
My family, my friends, completely strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying not to disappoint these people, and now I deliberately turned the world upside down.
I burned the pages of the script we were all following for so long, but if you do not throw those grenade, it will kill you.
One of my most memorable shots of grenades was at my sister's wedding.
And after a little fuss, a woman shouted: "I love Nathan Lane!"
And that was when the battle with homosexual stereotypes began.
"Ash, did you ever go to Castro?"
"Well, we do have friends in San Francisco."
"We never went there, but we heard it should be sober."
"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?
He is really good and he never mentioned a girlfriend'.
"Ash, which TV program do you like most?
Our favorite show: Will and Grace.
And do you know who we love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite.'
And then a woman, overburdened but desperate, tried to show me her support and, in order to let me know that she was on my side, she burst out: 'Well, my husband sometimes wears pink shirts'.
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-friendly table and make fun of her reactions, punish her foreignness and her inability to overcome the obstacles of political correctness to homosexuality that I had set, or I could engage with her and realize that this was perhaps one of the hardest things they ever did, that starting and conducting the conversation was a big step for her.
Sure, it would have been easier to point the finger at their ambiguity.
It is much harder to meet them where they are and to acknowledge the fact that they have tried.
And what can you ask of someone other than trying?
When you start to be honest with someone, you must be prepared to get honesty back.
Hard conversations are still not my strength.
Ask anyone I have ever met.
But I am improving and I follow what I like to call the three pancake-girl principles.
Look through this rainbow-coloured spectacle, but with the knowledge that it is always difficult to reveal its secret.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take off the tank and be yourself.
The child in the cafe did not have a tank, but I was ready to fight.
If you want someone to be honest with you, he must know that you too are suffering.
Number two: be direct, simply say it, pull off the pavement.
If you know that you are gay, just say it.
If you tell your parents that you may be homosexual, they will hope that this will change.
Do not give you the hint of false hope.
You are telling your own truth.
Never apologize for that.
And on this path some people may have been hurt, certainly, apologize for what you have done, but never apologize for what you are.
And yes, some may be disappointed, but that is their problem, not yours.
These are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
That is their story, not yours.
The only story that counts is the one you want to write.
So next time you feel pressed by your secret and you cling to the grenades, remember that we all know how it is.
You may feel very alone, but you are not.
We know that it is difficult, but you have to open up, no matter what your secret is, and I guarantee that there are many others who are carrying their secrets around, looking for the next brave soul to open a door, so be that person and show the world that we are stronger than our secrets and that a person should not live with secrets.
Intelligence -- What is it?
If we look at how intelligence has been interpreted in history, the famous quote by Edsger Dijkstra was a breakthrough: 'The question of whether a machine can think is roughly as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim'.
When Edsger Dijkstra wrote this, he wanted to criticize the early pioneers of computer science, such as Alan Turing.
But if we look back and think about which groundbreaking inventions have enabled us most to build floating machines and thinking [flying] machines, we see that only understanding the physical mechanism of swimming and flying has enabled us to build these machines.
That is why I started a few years ago to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanism of intelligence.
Let us take a step back.
and start with a thought experiment.
Imagine if we were aliens who know nothing about earth biology, neuroscience, or intelligence, but who have fantastic telescopes with which we can observe the earth, and who have an amazingly long life, so that we can observe the earth for millions, even billions of years.
We see a very strange effect here.
asteroids, which would otherwise have collided with the earth, are mysteriously diverted or exploded before they hit the earth over the millennia, approximately in the year 2000 AD.
As Earth dwellers, we know of course the real reason for this, namely that we are trying to save ourselves.
We try to avoid a knock-on.
But if you were an alien who didn’t know anything about all this, who had no idea of earthly intelligence, you would be forced to establish a physical theory why asteroids that destroyed the surface of the planet by a certain point in time are mysterically no longer doing so.
I would say that this is the same question as the question of the physical nature of intelligence.
That is why, in the experiment I launched a few years ago, I looked at many different topics from different scientific fields, all of which, I think, point to a single mechanism underpinning intelligence.
So, with the knowledge I have gathered from all these different areas, I wondered a few years ago whether there is a mechanism underlying intelligence that we can filter out from all these strands of thought?
Is there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer, I think, is yes ["F = T ∈ Sτ"]. What you are seeing is probably the best equivalent to E = mc2 for intelligence that I have seen.
What you see here is a statement of agreement that intelligence is a force that works in such a way that the future freedom of action is maximized.
It acts in such a way that the future freedom of action is maximized, or holds open options, with a strength, with the diversity of possible achievable futures, up to a future time horizon.
In short, intelligence does not like to fall into a trap.
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open.
Well, with this one equation, it is quite natural to ask what we can do with it.
What can it predict?
Does it predict human intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
Now I will show you a video which, I believe, will demonstrate some of the amazing applications of this equation.
But what if this possible cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence suggests a deeper connection?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy, but even develops directly from it?
To find out, we developed an engine, [an independent part of a computer program] "Entropica", to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which the engine is located.
Amazingly, Entropica passed many animal intelligence tests, played games successfully, and even made money with stocks, each without any instructions.
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.
Like a person standing upright without falling, we see Entropica automatically balancing a bar on a car.
This behavior is remarkable because we never gave Entropia a target.
She simply decided to balance the bar.
This ability to balance will find application for humanoid robotics and technical aids.
Just as some animals use objects in their environment as tools to penetrate narrow spaces, we see here that Entropica has again managed, on its own initiative, to move a large disk representing an animal so that a small disk, a tool, enters a limited space containing a third disk, and frees the third disk from its fixation.
This ability will be used in elegant production techniques and agriculture.
Furthermore, just as some animals cooperate by pulling at both ends of a rope simultaneously to get food, we see here that Entropia manages to implement this in the model.
This capacity for cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and many other areas.
Entropica can be used in a wide range of areas.
Here we see them playing a Pong game against themselves, which shows their potential in playing.
Here we see Entropica arranging new connections in social networks where friends keep losing contact; she successfully maintains the network.
The same ability of networking is also used in medical care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see Entropica leading a fleet of ships that successfully discovered and used the Panama Canal to extend its global reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
For the same reason, Entropica is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defence, logistics and transport.
Finally, we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and applying a "buy cheap, sell expensive" strategy on a simulated distance trading exchange, thereby exponentially increasing the assets under management.
This risk management capacity will be widely used in finance and insurance.
Alex Wissner-Gross: We have just seen that a multitude of clearly human-intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as tool use, steady walking and social cooperation, all follow from a single equation that makes a system maximize its future freedom of action.
This leads to a deep irony.
If we go back to the beginning of the use of the word "robot", the game "RUR", there was always the concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a Cyclopean revolt.
The machines would turn against us.
One important conclusion from this work is that we may have seen the concept of cybernetic revolts wrongly for decades.
Machines are not first intelligent and then megalomania, and try to conquer the world.
Another important consequence is targeting.
I am often asked how the ability to seek goals results from this basic structure?
Finally, Richard Feynman, a famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilisation were destroyed and only one concept could be passed on to our descendants to support reconstruction, it should be this: that all matter around us is made up of tiny elements that attract when they are far away, but reject when they are close together.
My equivalent of saying to leave something to their descendants to support the development of artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence should be seen as a physical process that seeks to maximize future freedom of action, avoiding restrictions of the future.
Thank you.
