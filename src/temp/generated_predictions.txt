A fellow student of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago and said she thinks I'm a bit too shy.
She would not vaccinate her child against polio - certainly not.
If you are not a player, you may miss some of the nuances in this picture.
If you feel ill - if you fall easily into impotence - I showed it to a few friends last night in the hotel room, and to some people I didn't know, and one woman almost fell impotent.
It has, in a sense, confounded us.
It is about how satisfied or happy the person is when that person thinks about his life.
And today I wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl shaped my self-image and how I could imagine myself as a strong, powerful and athletic person by nature.
I found it really extraordinary that he collected newspaper excerpts from my entire childhood, whether I had won a second-class bookbinding contest, whether I was walking with the Scouts at the Halloween parade, whether I had won my scholarship or one of my sporting victories, and he used these excerpts to teach his students, medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I found something very fundamental: in most the existence of life in individual organisms, each cell divides, and all the genetic information of the cell is kept in both daughter cells.
She looks at him and says, 'I'm here for super sex'.
Let me now present eLEGS, worn by Amanda Boxtel, who suffered a spinal injury 19 years ago, which has resulted in her not being able to walk for 19 years and until now.
its fully non-invasive sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer, which is attached here on their back.
Here are also battery packs, the motor drive is located on their hips and on their knee joints, which move them forward in this quite smooth and very natural way of walking.
When I found the captain, he had just had a very serious conversation with the housewife, who certainly had one of the worst days of her life.
It was in the middle of the night and she was standing barefoot under a shelter in the rain, while her house was in flames.
You must go up, pass the fire and get this woman a pair of shoes.'
A few weeks later, the fire brigade received a letter from the house owner, thanking her for her brave efforts in rescuing her house.
A very much appreciated kindness: someone even brought her a pair of shoes.
So here we see a young female and a male in a chase game.
And I would like to show you that this is Fuku, a young female, and she plays peacefully with water.
And very often I have worked with intersexual people whose gender is atypical -- people who do not have the average male or female body types.
As a consequence, the body develops more in line with the typical female progression.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl, and she is educated as a girl.
But it usually takes until she reaches puberty and her breasts grow and develop, but she doesn't get her period until someone comes to realize that something is different here.
And they do some tests and find out that instead of having eggs and uterus, she actually carries testicles and that she has a Y chromosome.
Most women, like me -- I think I'm a typical woman -- I don't know my actual chromosome structure, but I think I probably have the typical one -- most women like me actually talk about androgens.
As a result, someone like me actually has a brain that has been exposed to more androgens than a woman born with testicles and has an androgen receptor defect.
And only when he was 19 years old did he get enough medical problems, actually because he was menstruating internally that the doctors found that he was internally female.
So we have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity; being a black person means, supposedly, having an African anatomy in relation to one's own history.
Where I have seen the most excitement recently was the South African runner Caster Semenya last year, whose gender was called into question at the World Lesbian Pride Competition in Berlin.
We now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature does not draw a line between male and female, or between male and intersexual and female and intersexual; in fact, it is we who claim that this line of division is natural.
Only because Maria was born 3 months prematurely, she gains all possible rights three months before Henry -- the right to have agreed sex, the right to choose, the right to drink.
So, for example, Texas decided at one point that when you marry a man you do not have a Y chromosome, and when you marry a woman you do have a Y chromosome.
He said, 'Tell me what is female in feminism'.
Feminism is about dismantling stereotypes about gender, so nothing is feminine about feminism.
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought that there might be something feminine in feminism.
This means that there might be something, on average, that makes female brains different from male brains, which makes us more attentive to highly complex social relations and more attentive to protecting the vulnerable.
And since you didn’t hear of me as the woman walking around here at TED in her underwear – that means I found a few things.
So I went home and ate dinner with my wife and told her about everything and we thought, 'Well, second, if there is this technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things, then we should find a way that TEMPT can control a laser so that he can do graffiti again, that would be brilliant.'
My wife, my children and I moved into the garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
She saved my life by having me use the toilet in the teacher's room.
It did so in secret.
she did it for three years,
We saw her, we laughed, we wept, and we knew she had to be in a hospice.
We found one for them, we brought them there and we looked after them, and we looked after their family because it was necessary.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult met me, she turned into a box of ash and was put in my hands.
She saved my life and my partner and I saved her.
I could see it in their eyes, there was horror, life was over.
I did not argue with my wife for two years.
About a month after that I visited a performance of my daughter – first-year-old, not much artistic talent...
We will be equipped for men and women -- fixed, roll-on, or stick, whatever.
Ms 2: Partly hippie, partly yogi, partly Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.
18 months ago I was doing something else at Google and I suggested doing something with museums and art, and my boss, who is also today, gave me the green light.
Many of them are fathers who are forced to abandon their families in order to find work- sometimes single mothers who have to earn enough money to afford food and clothing.
How can I speak in ten minutes about the attachment between women over three generations, and how the astonishing strength of this attachment was manifested in the life of a four-year-old girl when she sat together with her little sister, mother and grandmother in a small boat in the Chinese Sea over 30 years ago, a attachment that remained embedded in the life of this little girl and never disappeared – this little girl who now lives in San Francisco and is speaking to you today?
My mother Mai was 18 when her father died – already in an arranged marriage, already with two little girls.
For her life, life had given her a task: the flight of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was entirely excluded that it would fail.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small poison bottle.
If I were taken captive, my sister and I would have drunk first, then she would have drunk it and my grandmother would have drunk it.
My mother worked on farms, then on a assembly line in a car factory, six days, double layers.
She managed to find the time to acquire English and IT qualifications.
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we told each other about our day, and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares from the boat.
And it was my task to remain awake every night until their nightmares came, that I might awaken them.
She opened a computer shop, then went on to become a beautician and opened another shop.
Tan Le, an anonymous resident of Footscray, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to lectures in places she never heard of and in homes she never imagined existed.
I wanted to return to the routine and comfort of the life of an unknown suburb – a grandmother, a mother and two daughters who ended each of their days as they had done for twenty years, telling each other the stories of their day and sleeping, we three still in the same bed.
I told my mother I would not manage to do that.
She reminded me that I was as old as she was when we climbed the boat.
"Just do it," she said, "and do not be what you are not."
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person.
Her father died shortly after her birth.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother she beat.
Without her husband’s support, she caused a sensation by bringing him to court and being a prosecutor in her own case, and an even greater sensation when she won.
I was sleeping in a hotel room in Sydney when she died, 1000 km away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower partition and saw it on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother called me a few minutes later.
A few days later we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her coffin.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
My mother asked us to touch her hand.
She asked the monk, 'Why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold?'
Tan’s mother is also in the fourth or fifth row here today.
She does not do it scientifically – she offers a cup of coffee or tea and asks patients, families, relatives, "How is it?
I grew up in a family, a traditional African-American household, dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was a brave, strong woman, she had an effect.
She had the last word in every family dispute.
It was also the starting point of many disputes in our family.
She was the daughter of a slave family.
Her parents were born in Virginia as slaves in the 1840s.
She was born around 1880 and the experience of slavery shaped her worldview very strongly.
My grandmother was strong, but she was also loving.
When I met her as a little boy she came to me and hugged me.
There was something about her that made you want to be always close to her.
The only problem was that she had ten children.
My mother was the youngest of her ten children.
Sometimes when I wanted to spend time with her, it was hard to get her attention.
I looked at her and smiled, but she looked very serious.
Then she stood up and came over to me, holding my hand and saying, »Come, Bryan, you and I, we have to talk.«
She took me out and said, »Bryan, I will tell you something, but you must promise that you will not tell it any further.«
She said, "honourable word? " I said, "Yes."
She sat down and looked at me, and said, »I want you to know that I was watching you.«
She said, »I think you are something special.«
She said, »I think you can do anything you want to do.«
Then she said, »You only have to promise me three things, Bryan.«
She said, "First tell me you'll always love your mom."
She said, »Your mom is my baby and you must promise that you will always take care of her.«
Then she said, »Next tell me that you will always do the right thing.« even if it is difficult to do the right thing.«
Finally, she said, "The last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol."
I grew up in the countryside, in the old rural south and I have a brother who is one year older and a sister who is one year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and brought this six pack of beer with him, my sister and I grabbed it and went into the forest with us.
Then he took a cup of beer and offered one to my sister, and she took one, and then they offered one to me.
I had something, your sister had something, so go on, drink a beer.'
Of course, my grandmother would tell all her grandchildren that they are special.
And she believed that these were the issues we should be looking at.
Then a woman said: »With our history it is impossible that we will ever again speak out in favour of the systematic killing of people.
Ms Parks kept returning to Montgomery, where she met two of her oldest friends, those older women, Johnnie Carr, who organized the Montgomery bus boycott – an incredible African-American – and Virginia Durr, a white whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
One day I sat there listening to these women and after a few hours, Mrs Parks turned around me and said: "Well, Bryan, tell me what the 'Equal Rights Initiative' is.
I started with my usual talk.
I gave my usual talk and she looked at me and said, »Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm.«
She said, »It will make you very, very tired.«
Then Mrs Carr stood up to me, put a finger on my face and said, »And therefore you must be very, very brave.«
And when these people came and looked at who the best protein container in the world was, it was not a MIT professor, nor a CalTech student, it was someone from England, Manchester, a woman who worked as a daytime assistant in a rehab clinic and was the best protein container in the world at night.
I looked at Mrs Drucker and she was in a state of breath.
And as I heard her she made a shivering sound.
And when I heard her chest with the stethoscope, I heard a cracking sound on both sides, which told me that she suffered from congestive heart failure.
I gave her aspirin, I gave her medicine to take the pressure off her heart.
I gave her medicine we call diuretics, water tablets, so she chose the liquid.
And over a period of one and a half to two hours, she began to feel better.
And then I made my first mistake; I sent them home.
I sent her home without talking to my chief doctor.
I did not pick up the listener and did what I should have done, which would have been a call to my chief doctor to clarify it with him so that he would have had a chance to get his own picture.
By sending them home, I disregarded a quiet voice in me who tried to say to me, 'Goldman, no good idea, don't do it'.
In fact, I was so lack of self-assurance that I asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs Drucker, 'Do you think it is OK for her to go home?'
So I signed the redundancy papers and an ambulance and rescue assistants came and brought them home.
So she was back.
She was back and dying.
Around one hour after she arrived at home, after I sent her home, she collapsed and the family called 911 and the rescue workers took her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50, which is a dangerous state of shock.
She barely breathed and had started to become blue.
They gave their blood pressure increasers.
They connected them to the ventilator.
And I went through this rollercoaster because she came to ICU after stabilization and I hoped she would recover.
And after two or three days it became clear that you would never wake up again.
She had suffered untreatable brain damage.
On the next day they let them go -- Mrs. Drucker, a woman, a mother and grandmother.
Why did I not ask the chief doctor, why did I send her home?
Two days later I came to my next emergency service and my chief doctor asked me to come to her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
The newly defined doctor is a person who knows about his humanity, accepts it, is not proud of making mistakes, but does everything to learn from them so that it can be passed on.
She shares her experience with others.
And she shows others their mistakes, not to expose them, but in a loving, supportive way so that everyone benefits.
And she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people breathe life into the system and, if so, people make mistakes from time to time.
My educated mother became a teacher.
That is it.
Two years ago she retired just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
He boasts not only of my university degree, but also of being the first woman to drive him through Kabul by car.
Almost a month ago, his daughter and he were on their way from SOLA to their village and they escaped the death of a bomb on the roadside in just a few minutes.
When he arrived at home, the phone rang and a voice threatened him that if he continued to send his daughter to school, they would try again.
As far as Afghanistan is concerned, I have recognized something that is often dismissed in the West: behind most of us who have success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that her success is also his success.
You should read the book 'Dead Aid' by Dambisa Moyo, who is a Zambian economist.
Just read your book.
The passion for the individual's own growth is the most important thing.
But as the conversation developed, I felt like Alice kneeling down to the rabbit hole and seeing a door to a completely new world.
First of all, it is just that I call my wife and she calls me and we talk a couple of times.
I remember the time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night, they were in my garden and I came out and they looked so ashamed.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it affected them and how they planted with their mother and grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed them, if only for a moment.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she crossed a red light and of course we were stopped, and it took only one "sorry, Mr Wachtmeister," and we could go on.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother, who died in exile: 'Son, resist Gaddafi, fight him.
I led an initiative by the Libyans' Platform for Peace to achieve a more co-decision-making electoral law, a law that should give every citizen, regardless of background, the right to vote and stand for election and, above all, to establish a vertical and horizontal alternation between male and female candidates for political parties, thereby creating a zip-line list.
Has the zip-line list and the change between female and male candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
Perhaps women were not the only missing, but rather the female values of compassion, grace and inclusion.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the feminine.
We must develop a female discourse that not only values but also implements the following values: grace instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the interweaving of feminine and masculine views.
The word "raheem", known in all the Abrahamic traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "rahem" — mother's womb — and symbolizes the maternal feminine that surrounds all mankind, from which the masculine and the feminine, from which all tribes and all peoples have sprung.
A lifeless woman lay on the floor, and a malnourished child in her arm looked helplessly at his mother's face.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without a family.
He can’t remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release of every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, while playing the very first episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga’s birthday.
She was a mother to me and her death came suddenly and unexpectedly.
'Before I die, I want to hold it in my arms again'.
As a young boy, I worked all day in my room and once even dismantled my mother’s new radio, which almost killed me the day before, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
She had lost many of her animals to lions and she asked me if I could install the lights for her.
My story begins when I was in New York for a lecture and my wife made this picture of my daughter on her first birthday on my arm.
As my daughter's third birthday approached, my wife said, 'Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do it a father-daughter trip to continue the ritual?'
While we always take the same picture, our perspective changes from time to time.
Lastly, during one of our trips, we walked and suddenly she stood like a wurst, pointing to a red awning at a doll shop that she had learned to love as a little child, during previous trips.
And she told me about the feelings she felt as a five-year-old in this place.
She said that she remembers when she first saw the shop nine years ago how her heart jumped.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
When Alex came to the first session, she was wearing jeans and a foul top, fell on the sofa in my office, shoved her sandals off and told me she was going to talk about men’s problems.
My fellow student was the first patient to be taken by a arsonist.
"30 is the new 20", said Alex and as far as I could guess she was right.
But soon my supervisor urged me to question Alex's love life.
And then my supervisor said: "Not yet, but perhaps she marries the next.
Also, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she is married."
I realized that this kind of harmless neglect was a serious problem with real consequences, not only for Alex and her love life, but for the careers, families and prospects of all people in the 20s.
We know that personality changes more often during the 20s than at any other time in life, and that women's fertility reaches its peak at the age of 28, and that things get complicated after 35.
It is the story of Emma.
Emma came to my office when she was 25, because she had, as she put it, an identity crisis.
She said she would like to work in the art or entertainment sector, but she had not yet decided, so she would have been serving in the past years.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with her boyfriend, who allowed his temper to prevail over his ambitions.
And, while her 20s were hard, her years before were much worse.
She often cried in the meetings, but then she gathered and said, 'You cannot choose your family, but your friends'.
One day Emma came very struck and wept for almost the whole hour.
She had bought a directory and spent the whole morning entering her many contacts, but then she stood on the blank spot after the words: "In case of an emergency, please notify...".
She was almost hysterical when she looked at me and said, 'Who will be there for me if I have a car accident?
Emma needed a better life and I knew this was her chance.
This was true for her when she grew up, but as she was in the twenty-first century, she would soon choose her own family if she chose a partner and started a family.
We went through her address book and she found the co-worker of a cousin who worked in a museum in another state.
This weak band helped her get a job there.
This offer of work gave her the reason to leave her boyfriend with whom she lived.
She married a man she chose deliberately.
She loves her new career and her new family and she sends me a card which said: 'Now the line 'in case of emergency contact' is not big enough'.
But my mother said 'no'.
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice with this book about a family of writers and musicians. ["Briefe der Familie von Fu Lei"] I found my model in an independent woman, while the Confucian tradition requires obedience. ["Jane Eyre"] From this book I learned to be efficient. ["Im Dutzend billiger"] Books inspired me to study abroad.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came into the class and she was as impressive as new girls always seem to be.
She had long shiny hair and a small cute pen, was good at geography and spelling.
In the first volume, "In Swann's World", in the novel series, Swann, one of the protagonists, thinks very lovingly about his lover and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences – Proust's sentences, they are as long as rivers – he looks up and realizes: "Wait, all I love about this woman would someone else love about this woman.
Whatever she gives me and what makes me happy could also make someone else happy, perhaps even at this moment'.
He says: 'A woman we need, who makes us suffer, conjures up a greater and broader spectrum of feelings than the genius of a man who interests us'.
One day Freud was visited by a very anxious young man who was consumed by the thought that his wife was cheating him.
And Freud says: this man is somehow strange because he doesn’t even look at what his wife does.
Instead, he looks for things his wife does without notice, i.e. unintentional behavior.
Does she smile too much or does she happen to meet a man?
A 52-year-old woman from Michigan was arrested for having written offensive, offensive messages to herself for a year from a fake Facebook account she had created.
She tried to blame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend for this and I admit that when I heard it I reacted with admiration.
She is the most brilliant and strange woman in American literature.
Take Tom Ripley, their most famous figure.
A play about a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
I was sitting at the head of the acting department, I screamed hysterically as if someone had shot my cat, and asked her why, she told me that they feared I wouldn’t get the stunts.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary.
And she looked at me and said: 'Five, four, three, two '.
When I watch online videos, I see comments like: "Hey, why is it so chicky?"
"Ah, is it stupid?"
Is she ill?
when the Apollo 17 was taken off and my mother warned me not to look too much into the fiery exhaust of the Saturn V rocket.
Her clothes cover only the essentials, she sings "Hit Me Baby One More Time" while she dancing on your living table.
Perhaps I know by chance that she doesn't drive well.
I love to watch my own favorite movies with my children.
The film has not let them go for months.
Her favorite character was of course Glinda.
So she had a good excuse to wear a glittering dress and a magic wand.
It took 40 years for this trend to spread, with – interestingly – another film in which a metal guy and a very furry guy rescued a girl by disguising themselves as the enemy’s guards.
Has he noticed that there are only boys in the universe, except for Aunt Beru and of course this princess who is really cool, but who is actually waiting most of the time so that she can reward the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he did thanks to the magic with which he was born?
How does Dorothy make her film a good end?
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not give me the appropriate model that I could use to find the adult world in which girls and boys are taught together.
"Ah, I can't believe that Pixar made a princess movie."
Alison Bechdel is a comic book author and during the mid-1980s she recorded this conversation with a friend about the evaluation of the films they had seen.
It is quite simple, there are only three questions you need to ask: is there more than one character in the movie who is a woman and says something?
In 2011, among the 100 most popular movies, what do you think how many of those actually had female lead actresses?
Do you take the story that it is the job of a male hero to defeat the villain with force and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and does not speak?
As a parent who has the privilege of bringing up a daughter, as well as those of you who do the same, we find this world and these statistics very alarming and we want to prepare for them.
We have means such as 'girls' power and we hope that this will help, but I also wonder whether girls' power will protect them if we teach our sons, actively or passively, at the same time, to maintain their 'boys' power.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars", do you know what she said?
I grew up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, and one of my most beautiful memories is how my mother showed me the beauty, shape and shape of Chinese characters.
If the outline for "fire" shows a person with high arms as if he were crying: "Help, I burn!"... The font is originally derived from the shape of the fire, but I like that idea, take the one you like best.
And one of their favorite occupations is looking at themselves in the mirror.
She loves her reflection very much.
She licks, squeezes and gives herself these large, moist kisses.
This is Faye, who lives in Denver, Colorado.
And like every teenager, she wants to be liked and belong.
She is a bit confused, even though her mother tells her that she is beautiful, someone in school tells her every day that she is ugly.
Because her mother says one thing and her friends or school colleagues says another, she doesn’t know whom to believe.
This is an average, healthy-looking girl who gets this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times of her life.
It is not acceptable that we should assess the contribution of our female politicians on the basis of their haircuts, the size of their breasts, or conclude that the success of an Olympic woman depends on her appearance.
A girlfriend or a woman sitting just a little further away.
What would it mean for her if she were freed from this voice, her inner critic, which reproaches her for having longer legs, thinner thighs, a smaller stomach or smaller feet?
What would it mean for them if we overcame this and released their potential?
I was born in 1983 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the son of an Egyptian engineer and a loving American and primary school teacher who together did their best to offer me a happy childhood.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview began to change, and she said something to me that I will carry in my heart for as long as I live.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of a woman who had experienced dogmatism for her entire life and said, 'I am tired of hating people'.
We have just seen part of this work from Nancy Kanwisher when she presented her wonderful work.
Is it aware?
If you are advocating the informational, pan-psychic view, you certainly have a high level of information processing and integration, so the answer should be yes, it is aware.
To be honest, it has not yet achieved anything'. And they were right.
You may know the story of the little girl without hands painting a picture with a pen in her mouth.
where a 15-year-old girl looking in her room at "Buffy – In the spell of demons" is not considered a success man just because she is sitting;
I took this photo last year when this young woman spoke to a policeman and thought about her life.
I am very glad to tell you that we were successful on that day in getting them to the other side of the fence.
We remember the Greek mythology: Zeus created Pandora and sent her to the earth, along with a book, and said to her: 'Never open, never open this book'.
And one day, when curiosity defeated Pandora, she opened the bookcase.
I thought up this talk only a few days ago and I received an email from a lady who I would like to read out to you.
She lost her son on 19 January this year and she wrote this email to me only a few days earlier and, with her permission and blessing, I am reading it to you.
I cannot imagine how much courage it has taken her to go to the bridge and go the way her son took that day, nor how much courage it needs to continue.
And in the end she writes: "P.S. When I visited the San Francisco hospital that evening, you were registered as a patient.
I was standing in front of the stage and I still remember that this beautiful woman came out, right in front of me, and at that moment I knew: this kind of woman was what I wanted to be.
When I was 15 years old, still dressed as a boy, I met a woman called T.L.
She was a manager of transgender beauty contests.
That evening she asked me: 'Why don't you participate in the beauty contest?'
Not many people were in the first job beauty queen in recruitment for transgender women, but I like it.
Two weeks later she called again and said,'Did you know that you can change your name and gender when you move to the US?'
She also accompanied me when I had my operation in Thailand at the age of 19.
I am thinking of a woman called Ayla Nettles.
She is from New York, a young woman who bravely lived her truth, but hatred put an end to her life.
Before that she was my daughter, but now I am her father.
She is not welcomed, neither by her father nor by her mother.
A mother feels very uneasy when she has a girl.
When she brings up the first girl, the first daughter, she is sad.
When she brings up her second daughter, she is shocked and, while waiting for a son, when the third daughter is born, she feels guilty like a criminal.
It is not only the mother who suffers, but also the daughter, the newborn daughter, because when she grows older she also suffers.
At the age of five, at the age she should go to school, she stays at home while her brothers are taken into school.
Until the age of 12 she has somehow a good life.
It can be fun.
She can play with her friends on the street and move freely there like a butterfly.
But as a young girl, at the age of 13, she is forbidden to go out of school without male accompaniment.
She is locked up in the four walls of her own home.
She is no longer a free person.
She is being given the so-called honour of her father, her brothers and her family, and if she violates the so-called code of honour, she can even be killed.
A good girl must be very quiet, very modest and very submissive.
The model good girl must be very quiet.
She should be very silent and she should accept the decisions of her father and mother, and the decisions of the elderly, even if she does not like them.
Otherwise, it will be called disobedient.
In the words of a poet, she is married and wed to bring up further sons and daughters.
Dear Brothers and Sisters, when Malala was born, when I first looked her in the eye, believe me, I do not like newborns, quite honestly.
Long before she was born, I thought about her name, and was fascinated by the heroic, legendary Afghan freedom fighter.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand and I named my daughter after her.
A few days after Malala's birth, after the birth of my daughter, my cousin came by -- and it was purely by chance -- he came to my home and brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at that tree, it went back 300 years to our ancestors.
When she became older, at four and a half years of age, I took her into my school.
Well, you certainly ask why should I mention a girl being admitted to school?
Going to school means recognizing their identity and their name.
Going to school means entering the world of her dreams and hopes, where she can explore her talents for her future life.
I encouraged them to sit with me when my friends came to visit me.
I encouraged them to attend different meetings with me.
And all these good values I tried to anchor in her personality.
I shared these good values in my school, both with pupils and with students.
I taught my girls, I taught my pupils to learn the lesson of obedience.
At the age of 10, Malala rose up and stood up for her right to education.
She wrote a diary for a BBC blog, worked volunteers for the New York Times documentary, and spoke on every possible stage.
And their voice was the most powerful voice.
And that was why the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign, which was shot at her head from a very short distance on 9 October 2012.
As my daughter was floating between life and death, I whispered to my wife: 'Am I guilty of what happened to my daughter and your daughter?'
And she immediately replied: "Please do not blame you.
You put your life at risk for truth, for peace, and for education, and your daughter was inspired by you and followed you.
While Malala was in hospital suffering severe pain, severe headache because her facial nerve was cut, I saw a dark shadow spreading on my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained.
She always said to us: "My shallow smile is fine, and my deafness in the face is fine.
She was a comfort for us and she gave us a favour.
Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her resilience in the most difficult times and I am glad to share it with you.
It cries when its homework is not complete.
She is arguing with her brothers, which I am very happy about.
I did not put their wings on the ground, that is all.
Imagine if a film director were able to direct the world only with his imagination.
Your outing can be to tell someone for the first time that you love her, or to tell someone that you are pregnant, or to tell someone that you have cancer, or one of the other difficult conversations we have in our lives.
The father moved his newspaper, and the mother turned a cool look at her child.
So I breathe deep, look down and a 4-year-old girl in a pink dress looks at me, no challenge to a feminist duel, just a child asking: 'Are you a boy or a girl?'
Why? Because the pancake girl and I were honest with each other.
And then a woman, overburdened but desperate, tried to show me her support and, in order to let me know that she was on my side, she burst out: 'Well, my husband sometimes wears pink shirts'.
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-friendly table and make fun of her reactions, punish her foreignness and her inability to overcome the obstacles of political correctness to homosexuality that I had set, or I could engage with her and realize that this was perhaps one of the hardest things they ever did, that starting and conducting the conversation was a big step for her.
But I am improving and I follow what I like to call the three pancake-girl principles.
